# 1.5.1 (2014-03-10)
### Fixes
- maxDataPoints must be an integer #184 (thanks @frejsoya for fixing this)

For people who are find Grafana slow for large time spans or high resolution metrics. This is most likely due to graphite returning a large number of datapoints. The maxDataPoints parameter solves this issue. For maxDataPoints to work you need to run the latest graphite-web (some builds of 0.9.12 does not include this feature).
