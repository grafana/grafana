# The thread that writes metrics to disk can use one of the following strategies

#
# sorted - All metrics in the cache will be counted and an ordered list of
# them will be sorted according to the number of datapoints in the cache at the
# moment of the list's creation. Metrics will then be flushed from the cache to
# disk in that order.
#
# timesorted - All metrics in the list will be looked at and sorted according
# to the timestamp of there datapoints. The metric that were the least recently
# written will be written first. This is an hybrid strategy between max and
# sorted which is particularly adapted to sets of metrics with non-uniform
# resolutions.
#
# max - The writer thread will always pop and flush the metric from cache
# that has the most datapoints. This will give a strong flush preference to
# frequently updated metrics and will also reduce random file-io. Infrequently
# updated metrics may only ever be persisted to disk at daemon shutdown if
# there are a large number of metrics which receive very frequent updates OR if
# disk i/o is very slow.
#
# naive - Metrics will be flushed from the cache to disk in an unordered
# fashion. This strategy may be desirable in situations where the storage for
# whisper files is solid state, CPU resources are very limited or deference to
# the OS's i/o scheduler is expected to compensate for the random write

# Only beneficial on linux filesystems that support the fallocate system call.

# MAX_CREATES_PER_MINUTE. If enabled on an OS or filesystem that is unsupported
# this option will gracefully fallback to standard POSIX file access methods.

# On systems which has a large number of metrics, an amount of Whisper write(2)'s

# By default all nodes stored in Ceres are cached in memory to improve the
# throughput of reads and writes to underlying slices. Turning this off will
# greatly reduce memory consumption for databases with millions of metrics, at
# the cost of a steep increase in disk i/o, approximately an extra two os.stat
# calls for every read and write. Reasons to do this are if the underlying
# storage can handle stat() with practically zero cost (SSD, NVMe, zRAM).
# Valid values are:
#       all - all nodes are cached
#      none - node caching is disabled
# CERES_NODE_CACHING_BEHAVIOR = all

# Ceres nodes can have many slices and caching the right ones can improve
# performance dramatically. Note that there are many trade-offs to tinkering
# with this, and unless you are a ceres developer you *really* should not
# mess with this. Valid values are:
#    latest - only the most recent slice is cached

# CERES_SLICE_CACHING_BEHAVIOR = latest

# If a Ceres node accumulates too many slices, performance can suffer.
# This can be caused by intermittently reported data. To mitigate
# slice fragmentation there is a tolerance for how much space can be
# wasted within a slice file to avoid creating a new one. That tolerance
# level is determined by MAX_SLICE_GAP, which is the number of consecutive
# null datapoints allowed in a slice file.
# If you set this very low, you will waste less of the *tiny* bit disk space
# that this feature wastes, and you will be prone to performance problems
# caused by slice fragmentation, which can be pretty severe.
# If you set this really high, you will waste a bit more disk space (each
# null datapoint wastes 8 bytes, but keep in mind your filesystem's block
# size). If you suffer slice fragmentation issues, you should increase this or
# run the ceres-maintenance defrag plugin more often. However you should not
# set it to be huge because then if a large but allowed gap occurs it has to
# get filled in, which means instead of a simple 8-byte write to a new file we
# could end up doing an (8 * MAX_SLICE_GAP)-byte write to the latest slice.
