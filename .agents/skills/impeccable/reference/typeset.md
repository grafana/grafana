Typography carries most of the information on the page. Replace generic defaults (Inter, Roboto, system fallback at flat scale) with type that reflects the brand and scales with intentional contrast.

## Register

Brand: run the font selection procedure in [brand.md](brand.md). Pairing follows the brand's lane (display serif + sans body for editorial/luxury, one committed sans for tech, etc.). Fluid `clamp()` scale, ≥1.25 ratio between steps.

Product: system fonts and familiar sans stacks are legitimate here. One well-tuned family typically carries the whole UI. Fixed `rem` scale, 1.125–1.2 ratio between more closely-spaced steps.

## Assess Current Typography

Analyze what's weak or generic about the current type:

1. **Font choices**:
   - Are we using invisible defaults? (Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, system defaults)
   - Does the font match the brand personality? (A playful brand shouldn't use a corporate typeface)
   - Are there too many font families? (More than 2-3 is almost always a mess)

2. **Hierarchy**:
   - Can you tell headings from body from captions at a glance?
   - Are font sizes too close together? (14px, 15px, 16px = muddy hierarchy)
   - Are weight contrasts strong enough? (Medium vs Regular is barely visible)

3. **Sizing & scale**:
   - Is there a consistent type scale, or are sizes arbitrary?
   - Does body text meet minimum readability? (16px+)
   - Is the sizing strategy appropriate for the context? (Fixed `rem` scales for app UIs; fluid `clamp()` for marketing/content page headings)

4. **Readability**:
   - Are line lengths comfortable? (45-75 characters ideal)
   - Is line-height appropriate for the font and context?
   - Is there enough contrast between text and background?

5. **Consistency**:
   - Are the same elements styled the same way throughout?
   - Are font weights used consistently? (Not bold in one section, semibold in another for the same role)
   - Is letter-spacing intentional or default everywhere?

**CRITICAL**: The goal isn't to make text "fancier." It's to make it clearer, more readable, and more intentional. Good typography is invisible; bad typography is distracting.

## Plan Typography Improvements

Consult the [typography reference](typography.md) for detailed guidance on scales, pairing, and loading strategies.

Create a systematic plan:

- **Font selection**: Do fonts need replacing? What fits the brand/context?
- **Type scale**: Establish a modular scale (e.g., 1.25 ratio) with clear hierarchy
- **Weight strategy**: Which weights serve which roles? (Regular for body, Semibold for labels, Bold for headings, or whatever fits)
- **Spacing**: Line-heights, letter-spacing, and margins between typographic elements

## Improve Typography Systematically

### Font Selection

If fonts need replacing:
- Choose fonts that reflect the brand personality
- Pair with genuine contrast (serif + sans, geometric + humanist), or use a single family in multiple weights
- Ensure web font loading doesn't cause layout shift (`font-display: swap`, metric-matched fallbacks)

### Establish Hierarchy

Build a clear type scale:
- **5 sizes cover most needs**: caption, secondary, body, subheading, heading
- **Use a consistent ratio** between levels (1.25, 1.333, or 1.5)
- **Combine dimensions**: Size + weight + color + space for strong hierarchy. Don't rely on size alone
- **App UIs**: Use a fixed `rem`-based type scale, optionally adjusted at 1-2 breakpoints. Fluid sizing undermines the spatial predictability that dense, container-based layouts need
- **Marketing / content pages**: Use fluid sizing via `clamp(min, preferred, max)` for headings and display text. Keep body text fixed

### Fix Readability

- Set `max-width` on text containers using `ch` units (`max-width: 65ch`)
- Adjust line-height per context: tighter for headings (1.1-1.2), looser for body (1.5-1.7)
- Increase line-height slightly for light-on-dark text
- Ensure body text is at least 16px / 1rem

### Refine Details

- Use `tabular-nums` for data tables and numbers that should align
- Apply proper `letter-spacing`: slightly open for small caps and uppercase, default or tight for large display text
- Use semantic token names (`--text-body`, `--text-heading`), not value names (`--font-16`)
- Set `font-kerning: normal` and consider OpenType features where appropriate

### Weight Consistency

- Define clear roles for each weight and stick to them
- Don't use more than 3-4 weights (Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold is plenty)
- Load only the weights you actually use (each weight adds to page load)

**NEVER**:
- Use more than 2-3 font families
- Pick sizes arbitrarily; commit to a scale
- Set body text below 16px
- Use decorative/display fonts for body text
- Disable browser zoom (`user-scalable=no`)
- Use `px` for font sizes; use `rem` to respect user settings
- Default to Inter/Roboto/Open Sans when personality matters
- Pair fonts that are similar but not identical (two geometric sans-serifs)

## Verify Typography Improvements

- **Hierarchy**: Can you identify heading vs body vs caption instantly?
- **Readability**: Is body text comfortable to read in long passages?
- **Consistency**: Are same-role elements styled identically throughout?
- **Personality**: Does the typography reflect the brand?
- **Performance**: Are web fonts loading efficiently without layout shift?
- **Accessibility**: Does text meet WCAG contrast ratios? Is it zoomable to 200%?

When the type carries the hierarchy on its own, hand off to `{{command_prefix}}impeccable polish` for the final pass.

## Live-mode signature params

Each variant MUST declare a `scale` param controlling the hierarchy ratio. Express all font sizes in the variant's scoped CSS through `calc(var(--p-scale, 1) * <base>)` or, better, scale the type ramp via `clamp(min, calc(var(--p-scale, 1) * Npx), max)`. Users slide from subdued to commanding.

```json
{"id":"scale","kind":"range","min":0.85,"max":1.3,"step":0.05,"default":1,"label":"Scale"}
```

Where the variant riffs on a specific pairing, expose the pairing choice as a `steps` param (e.g. "serif display + sans body" vs. "mono display + sans body" vs. "all-sans"). Each branch routes through `:scope[data-p-pairing="X"]` selectors in scoped CSS.

See `reference/live.md` for the full params contract.
