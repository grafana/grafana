# Grafana Pyroscope Data Source - Native Plugin

Grafana ships with **built in** support for Grafana Pyroscope, an open source continuous profiling platform.

## What is Grafana Pyroscope?

Grafana Pyroscope is an open source continuous profiling platform. It will help you:
* Find performance issues and bottlenecks in your code
* Use high-cardinality tags/labels to analyze your application
* Resolve issues with high CPU utilization
* Track down memory leaks
* Understand the call tree of your application
* Auto-instrument your code to link profiling data to traces
