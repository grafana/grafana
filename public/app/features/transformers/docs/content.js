Each transformation allows you to add one new field.\n\n- **Mode** - Select a mode:\n  - **Reduce row** - Apply selected calculation on each row of selected fields independently.\n  - **Binary operation** - Apply basic binary operations (for example, sum or multiply) on values in a single row from two selected fields.\n  - **Unary operation** - Apply basic unary operations on values in a single row from a selected field. The available operations are:\n    - **Absolute value (abs)** - Returns the absolute value of a given expression. It represents its distance from zero as a positive number.\n    - **Natural exponential (exp)** - Returns _e_ raised to the power of a given expression.\n    - **Natural logarithm (ln)** - Returns the natural logarithm of a given expression.\n    - **Floor (floor)** - Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given expression.\n    - **Ceiling (ceil)** - Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given expression.\n  - **Cumulative functions** - Apply functions on the current row and all preceding rows.\n    - **Total** - Calculates the cumulative total up to and including the current row.\n    - **Mean** - Calculates the mean up to and including the current row.\n  - **Window functions** - Apply window functions. The window can either be **trailing** or **centered**.\n    With a trailing window the current row will be the last row in the window.\n    With a centered window the window will be centered on the current row.\n    For even window sizes, the window will be centered between the current row, and the previous row.\n    - **Mean** - Calculates the moving mean or running average.\n    - **Stddev** - Calculates the moving standard deviation.\n    - **Variance** - Calculates the moving variance.\n  - **Row index** - Insert a field with the row index.\n- **Field name** - Select the names of fields you want to use in the calculation for the new field.\n- **Calculation** - If you select **Reduce row** mode, then the **Calculation** field appears. Click in the field to see a list of calculation choices you can use to create the new field. For information about available calculations, refer to [Calculation types][].\n- **Operation** - If you select **Binary operation** or **Unary operation** mode, then the **Operation** fields appear. These fields allow you to apply basic math operations on values in a single row from selected fields. You can also use numerical values for binary operations.\n- **As percentile** - If you select **Row index** mode, then the **As percentile** switch appears. This switch allows you to transform the row index as a percentage of the total number of rows.\n- **Alias** - (Optional) Enter the name of your new field. If you leave this blank, then the field will be named to match the calculation.\n- **Replace all fields** - (Optional) Select this option if you want to hide all other fields and display only your calculated field in the visualization.\n\n> **Note:** **Cumulative functions** and **Window functions** modes are currently in public preview.

This table lists all fields found in the data returned by the config query, along with **Use as** and **Select** options. It provides control over mapping fields to config properties, and for multiple rows, it allows you to choose which value to select.\n\n#### Example\n\nInput[0] (From query: A, name: ServerA)\n\n| Time          | Value |\n| ------------- | ----- |\n| 1626178119127 | 10    |\n| 1626178119129 | 30    |\n\nInput[1] (From query: B)\n\n| Time          | Value |\n| ------------- | ----- |\n| 1626178119127 | 100   |\n| 1626178119129 | 100   |\n\nOutput (Same as Input[0] but now with config on the Value field)\n\n| Time          | Value (config: Max=100) |\n| ------------- | ----------------------- |\n| 1626178119127 | 10                      |\n| 1626178119129 | 30                      |\n\nEach row in the source data becomes a separate field. Each field now has a maximum configuration option set. Options such as **Min**, **Max**, **Unit**, and **Thresholds** are part of the field configuration. If set, they are used by the visualization instead of any options manually configured in the panel editor options pane.\n\n#### Value mappings\n\nYou can also transform a query result into value mappings. With this option, every row in the configuration query result defines a single value mapping row. See the following example.\n\nConfig query result:\n\n| Value | Text   | Color |\n| ----- | ------ | ----- |\n| L     | Low    | blue  |\n| M     | Medium | green |\n| H     | High   | red   |\n\nIn the field mapping specify:\n\n| Field | Use as                  | Select     |\n| ----- | ----------------------- | ---------- |\n| Value | Value mappings / Value  | All values |\n| Text  | Value mappings / Text   | All values |\n| Color | Value mappings / Color | All values |\n\nGrafana builds value mappings from your query result and applies them to the real data query results. You should see values being mapped and colored according to the config query results.\n  ";

If we wanted to include the rows that have a temperature lower than 30\u00B0C *OR* an altitude higher than 100 instead, then we would select **Match any**. This would include the first row in the original data, which has a temperature of 32\u00B0C (does not match the first condition) but an altitude of 101 (which matches the second condition), so it is included.\n\nConditions that are invalid or incompletely configured are ignored.\n\nThis versatile data filtering transformation lets you to selectively include or exclude data points based on specific conditions.

First you specify one or multiple fields to group the data by. This will group all the same values of those fields together, as if you sorted them. For instance if we group by the Server ID field, then it would group the data this way:\n\n| Time                | Server ID      | CPU Temperature | Server Status |\n| ------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------- |\n| 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | **server 1**   | 80              | Shutdown      |\n| 2020-07-07 09:28:06 | **server 1**   | 80              | OK            |\n| 2020-07-07 09:23:07 | **server 1**   | 86              | OK            |\n| 2020-07-07 10:32:20 | server 2       | 90              | Overload      |\n| 2020-07-07 09:30:05 | server 2       | 88              | OK            |\n| 2020-07-07 09:25:05 | server 2       | 88              | OK            |\n| 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | **_server 3_** | 62              | OK            |\n| 2020-07-07 10:31:22 | **_server 3_** | 55              | OK            |\n| 2020-07-07 09:30:57 | **_server 3_** | 62              | Rebooting     |\n\nAll rows with the same value of Server ID are grouped together.\n\nAfter choosing which field you want to group your data by, you can add various calculations on the other fields, and apply the calculation to each group of rows. For instance, we could want to calculate the average CPU temperature for each of those servers. So we can add the _mean_ calculation applied on the CPU Temperature field to get the following:\n\n| Server ID | CPU Temperature (mean) |\n| --------- | ---------------------- |\n| server 1  | 82                     |\n| server 2  | 88.6                   |\n| server 3  | 59.6                   |\n\nAnd we can add more than one calculation. For instance:\n\n- For field Time, we can calculate the _Last_ value, to know when the last data point was received for each server\n- For field Server Status, we can calculate the _Last_ value to know what is the last state value for each server\n- For field Temperature, we can also calculate the _Last_ value to know what is the latest monitored temperature for each server\n\nWe would then get:\n\n| Server ID | CPU Temperature (mean) | CPU Temperature (last) | Time (last)         | Server Status (last) |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |\n| server 1  | 82                     | 80                     | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | Shutdown             |\n| server 2  | 88.6                   | 90                     | 2020-07-07 10:32:20 | Overload             |\n| server 3  | 59.6                   | 62                     | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | OK                   |\n\nThis transformation allows you to extract essential information from your time series and present it conveniently.\n  ";

The first acts on single series and extracts labels to fields. The second is the [merge](#merge) transformation that joins all the results into a single table. The merge transformation tries to join on all matching fields. This merge step is required and cannot be turned off.\n\nTo illustrate this, here is an example where you have two queries that return time series with no overlapping labels.\n\n- Series 1: labels Server=ServerA\n- Series 2: labels Datacenter=EU\n\nThis will first result in these two tables:\n\n| Time                | Server  | Value |\n| ------------------- | ------- | ----- |\n| 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | ServerA | 10    |\n\n| Time                | Datacenter | Value |\n| ------------------- | ---------- | ----- |\n| 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | EU         | 20    |\n\nAfter merge:\n\n| Time                | Server  | Value | Datacenter |\n| ------------------- | ------- | ----- | ---------- |\n| 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | ServerA | 10    |            |\n| 2020-07-07 11:34:20 |         | 20    | EU         |\n\nConvert your time series data into a structured table format for a clearer and more organized representation.\n  ";

But you can override this default setting by selecting **Field value** in the **Use as** column for the field you want to use instead.\n\nUseful when visualizing data in:\n\n- Gauge\n- Stat\n- Pie chart\n\n#### Map extra fields to labels\n\nIf a field does not map to config property Grafana will automatically use it as source for a label on the output field-\n\n**Example:**\n\n| Name    | DataCenter | Value |\n| ------- | ---------- | ----- |\n| ServerA | US         | 100   |\n| ServerB | EU         | 200   |\n\n**Output:**\n\n| ServerA (labels: DataCenter: US) | ServerB (labels: DataCenter: EU) |\n| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| 10                               | 20                               |\n\nThe extra labels can now be used in the field display name provide more complete field names.\n\nIf you want to extract config from one query and apply it to another you should use the config from query results transformation.\n\n#### Example\n\n**Input:**\n\n| Name    | Value | Max |\n| ------- | ----- | --- |\n| ServerA | 10    | 100 |\n| ServerB | 20    | 200 |\n| ServerC | 30    | 300 |\n\n**Output:**\n\n| ServerA (config: max=100) | ServerB (config: max=200) | ServerC (config: max=300) |\n| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| 10                        | 20                        | 30                        |\n\nAs you can see each row in the source data becomes a separate field. Each field now also has a max config option set. Options like **Min**, **Max**, **Unit** and **Thresholds** are all part of field configuration and if set like this will be used by the visualization instead of any options manually configured in the panel editor options pane.\n\nThis transformation enables the conversion of rows into individual fields, facilitates dynamic field configuration, and maps additional fields to labels.\n  ";
