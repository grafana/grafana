### Report bugs

Before submitting a new issue, try to make sure someone hasn't already reported the problem. Look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues) for similar issues.

Report a bug by submitting a [bug report](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/new?labels=type%3A+bug&template=1-bug_report.md). Make sure that you provide as much information as possible on how to reproduce the bug.

Follow the issue template and add additional information that will help us replicate the problem.

For data visualization issues:

- Query results from the inspect drawer (data tab & query inspector)
- Panel settings can be extracted in the panel inspect drawer JSON tab

For a dashboard related issues:

- Dashboard JSON can be found in the dashboard settings JSON model view

For authentication and alerting Grafana server logs are useful.
