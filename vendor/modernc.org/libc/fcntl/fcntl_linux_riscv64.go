//    _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if

//    The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance

//    example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
//    give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.
//
//    These are defined by this file and are used by the
//    header files to decide what to declare or define:
//
//    __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
// 			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
// 			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
// 			__GLIBC_USE.
//    __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
//    __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
//    __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
//    __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
//    __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
//    __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
//    __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
//    __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
//    __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
//    __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
//    __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
//    __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
//    __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
//    __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
//    __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
//    __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
//    __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
//    __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
//    __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
//    __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
//    __USE_DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE Define correct (but non compile-time constant)
// 			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
//    __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
//    __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.
//
//    The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
//    defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
//    only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
//    to test for features.
//
//    All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
//    explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
//    Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
//    but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
//    lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.
//
//    ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
//    when an affected header is included, not when the first system
//    header is included, and so they are handled in
//    <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
//    guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
//    system header included are handled here.

// Undefine everything, so we get a clean slate.

// Suppress kernel-name space pollution unless user expressedly asks
//    for it.

// Convenience macro to test the version of gcc.
//    Use like this:
//    #if __GNUC_PREREQ (2,8)
//    ... code requiring gcc 2.8 or later ...
//    #endif
//    Note: only works for GCC 2.0 and later, because __GNUC_MINOR__ was
//    added in 2.0.

// Similarly for clang.  Features added to GCC after version 4.2 may
//    or may not also be available in clang, and clang's definitions of
//    __GNUC(_MINOR)__ are fixed at 4 and 2 respectively.  Not all such
//    features can be queried via __has_extension/__has_feature.

// Whether to use feature set F.

// _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE are deprecated aliases for
//    _DEFAULT_SOURCE.  If _DEFAULT_SOURCE is present we do not
//    issue a warning; the expectation is that the source is being
//    transitioned to use the new macro.

// If _GNU_SOURCE was defined by the user, turn on all the other features.

// If nothing (other than _GNU_SOURCE and _DEFAULT_SOURCE) is defined,
//    define _DEFAULT_SOURCE.

// This is to enable the ISO C2X extension.

// This is to enable the ISO C11 extension.

// This is to enable the ISO C99 extension.

// This is to enable the ISO C90 Amendment 1:1995 extension.

// If none of the ANSI/POSIX macros are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE
//    is defined, use POSIX.1-2008 (or another version depending on
//    _XOPEN_SOURCE).

// Some C libraries once required _REENTRANT and/or _THREAD_SAFE to be
//    defined in all multithreaded code.  GNU libc has not required this
//    for many years.  We now treat them as compatibility synonyms for
//    _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L, which is the earliest level of POSIX with
//    comprehensive support for multithreaded code.  Using them never
//    lowers the selected level of POSIX conformance, only raises it.

// The function 'gets' existed in C89, but is impossible to use
//    safely.  It has been removed from ISO C11 and ISO C++14.  Note: for
//    compatibility with various implementations of <cstdio>, this test
//    must consider only the value of __cplusplus when compiling C++.

// GNU formerly extended the scanf functions with modified format
//    specifiers %as, %aS, and %a[...] that allocate a buffer for the
//    input using malloc.  This extension conflicts with ISO C99, which
//    defines %a as a standalone format specifier that reads a floating-
//    point number; moreover, POSIX.1-2008 provides the same feature
//    using the modifier letter 'm' instead (%ms, %mS, %m[...]).
//
//    We now follow C99 unless GNU extensions are active and the compiler
//    is specifically in C89 or C++98 mode (strict or not).  For
//    instance, with GCC, -std=gnu11 will have C99-compliant scanf with
//    or without -D_GNU_SOURCE, but -std=c89 -D_GNU_SOURCE will have the
//    old extension.

// We are almost always included from features.h.

// The GNU libc does not support any K&R compilers or the traditional mode
//    of ISO C compilers anymore.  Check for some of the combinations not
//    supported anymore.

// Some user header file might have defined this before.

// Compilers that lack __has_attribute may object to
//        #if defined __has_attribute && __has_attribute (...)
//    even though they do not need to evaluate the right-hand side of the &&.
//    Similarly for __has_builtin, etc.

// All functions, except those with callbacks or those that
//    synchronize memory, are leaf functions.

// GCC can always grok prototypes.  For C++ programs we add throw()
//    to help it optimize the function calls.  But this only works with
//    gcc 2.8.x and egcs.  For gcc 3.4 and up we even mark C functions
//    as non-throwing using a function attribute since programs can use
//    the -fexceptions options for C code as well.

// These two macros are not used in glibc anymore.  They are kept here
//    only because some other projects expect the macros to be defined.

// For these things, GCC behaves the ANSI way normally,
//    and the non-ANSI way under -traditional.

// This is not a typedef so `const __ptr_t' does the right thing.

// C++ needs to know that types and declarations are C, not C++.

// Fortify support.

// Use __builtin_dynamic_object_size at _FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 when available.

// Support for flexible arrays.
//    Headers that should use flexible arrays only if they're "real"
//    (e.g. only if they won't affect sizeof()) should test
//    #if __glibc_c99_flexarr_available.

// __asm__ ("xyz") is used throughout the headers to rename functions
//    at the assembly language level.  This is wrapped by the __REDIRECT
//    macro, in order to support compilers that can do this some other
//    way.  When compilers don't support asm-names at all, we have to do
//    preprocessor tricks instead (which don't have exactly the right
//    semantics, but it's the best we can do).
//
//    Example:
//    int __REDIRECT(setpgrp, (__pid_t pid, __pid_t pgrp), setpgid);

//
// #elif __SOME_OTHER_COMPILER__
//
// # define __REDIRECT(name, proto, alias) name proto; 	_Pragma("let " #name " = " #alias)

// GCC and clang have various useful declarations that can be made with
//    the '__attribute__' syntax.  All of the ways we use this do fine if
//    they are omitted for compilers that don't understand it.

// At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `malloc' attribute
//    for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
//    (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.

// Tell the compiler which arguments to an allocation function
//    indicate the size of the allocation.

// At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `pure' attribute
//    for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
//    (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.

// This declaration tells the compiler that the value is constant.

// At some point during the gcc 3.1 development the `used' attribute
//    for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
//    (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.

// Since version 3.2, gcc allows marking deprecated functions.

// Since version 4.5, gcc also allows one to specify the message printed
//    when a deprecated function is used.  clang claims to be gcc 4.2, but
//    may also support this feature.

// At some point during the gcc 2.8 development the `format_arg' attribute
//    for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
//    (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.
//    If several `format_arg' attributes are given for the same function, in
//    gcc-3.0 and older, all but the last one are ignored.  In newer gccs,
//    all designated arguments are considered.

// At some point during the gcc 2.97 development the `strfmon' format
//    attribute for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it
//    unconditionally (although this would be possible) since it
//    generates warnings.

// The nonnull function attribute marks pointer parameters that
//    must not be NULL.

// The returns_nonnull function attribute marks the return type of the function
//    as always being non-null.

// If fortification mode, we warn about unused results of certain
//    function calls which can lead to problems.

// Forces a function to be always inlined.
// The Linux kernel defines __always_inline in stddef.h (283d7573), and
//    it conflicts with this definition.  Therefore undefine it first to
//    allow either header to be included first.

// Associate error messages with the source location of the call site rather
//    than with the source location inside the function.

// GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
//    inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  Using __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__
//    or __GNUC_GNU_INLINE is not a good enough check for gcc because gcc versions
//    older than 4.3 may define these macros and still not guarantee GNU inlining
//    semantics.
//
//    clang++ identifies itself as gcc-4.2, but has support for GNU inlining
//    semantics, that can be checked for by using the __GNUC_STDC_INLINE_ and
//    __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ macro definitions.

// GCC 4.3 and above allow passing all anonymous arguments of an
//    __extern_always_inline function to some other vararg function.

// It is possible to compile containing GCC extensions even if GCC is
//    run in pedantic mode if the uses are carefully marked using the
//    `__extension__' keyword.  But this is not generally available before
//    version 2.8.

// __restrict is known in EGCS 1.2 and above, and in clang.
//    It works also in C++ mode (outside of arrays), but only when spelled
//    as '__restrict', not 'restrict'.

// ISO C99 also allows to declare arrays as non-overlapping.  The syntax is
//      array_name[restrict]
//    GCC 3.1 and clang support this.
//    This syntax is not usable in C++ mode.

// Describes a char array whose address can safely be passed as the first
//    argument to strncpy and strncat, as the char array is not necessarily
//    a NUL-terminated string.

// Undefine (also defined in libc-symbols.h).
// Copies attributes from the declaration or type referenced by
//    the argument.

// The #ifndef lets Gnulib avoid including these on non-glibc
//    platforms, where the includes typically do not exist.

// The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE

//    We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
//    variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.
//
// 	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
// 	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
// 	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
// 	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
// 	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
// 	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
// 	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long
//
//    We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
//    conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
//    types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
//    This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
//    these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
//    make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
//    we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
//    compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
//    and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
//    program's portability.
//
//    Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
//    we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
//    and int is always 32 bits.

// This file contains shared definitions between Linux architectures
//    and is included by <bits/fcntl.h> to declare them.  The various
//    #ifndef cases allow the architecture specific file to define those
//    values with different values.
//
//    A minimal <bits/fcntl.h> contains just:
//
//    struct flock {...}
//    #ifdef __USE_LARGEFILE64
//    struct flock64 {...}
//    #endif
//    #include <bits/fcntl-linux.h>

// open/fcntl.

// open file description locks.
//
//    Usually record locks held by a process are released on *any* close and are
//    not inherited across a fork.
//
//    These cmd values will set locks that conflict with process-associated record
//    locks, but are "owned" by the opened file description, not the process.
//    This means that they are inherited across fork or clone with CLONE_FILES
//    like BSD (flock) locks, and they are only released automatically when the
//    last reference to the the file description against which they were acquired
//    is put.

// For now, Linux has no separate synchronicity options for read
//    operations.  We define O_RSYNC therefore as the same as O_SYNC
//    since this is a superset.

// Values for the second argument to `fcntl'.

// For F_[GET|SET]FD.

// For posix fcntl() and `l_type' field of a `struct flock' for lockf().

// For old implementation of BSD flock.

// Operations for BSD flock, also used by the kernel implementation.

// Define some more compatibility macros to be backward compatible with
//    BSD systems which did not managed to hide these kernel macros.

// Advise to `posix_fadvise'.

// Values for `*at' functions.

// Detect if open needs mode as a third argument (or for openat as a fourth
//    argument).

// POSIX.1-2001 specifies that these types are defined by <fcntl.h>.
//
//	Earlier POSIX standards permitted any type ending in `_t' to be defined
//	by any POSIX header, so we don't conditionalize the definitions here.
