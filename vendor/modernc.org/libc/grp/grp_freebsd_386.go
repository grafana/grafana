// $FreeBSD$

// Testing against Clang-specific extensions.

// This code has been put in place to help reduce the addition of
// compiler specific defines in FreeBSD code.  It helps to aid in
// having a compiler-agnostic source tree.

// Compiler memory barriers, specific to gcc and clang.

// XXX: if __GNUC__ >= 2: not tested everywhere originally, where replaced

// Macro to test if we're using a specific version of gcc or later.

// The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.
// with "#define OLD(foo) __CONCAT(old,foo)", OLD(foo) produces oldfoo.
// The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky to use if it must work in non-ANSI
// mode -- there must be no spaces between its arguments, and for nested
// __CONCAT's, all the __CONCAT's must be at the left.  __CONCAT can also
// concatenate double-quoted strings produced by the __STRING macro, but
// this only works with ANSI C.
//
// __XSTRING is like __STRING, but it expands any macros in its argument
// first.  It is only available with ANSI C.

// Compiler-dependent macros to help declare dead (non-returning) and
// pure (no side effects) functions, and unused variables.  They are
// null except for versions of gcc that are known to support the features
// properly (old versions of gcc-2 supported the dead and pure features
// in a different (wrong) way).  If we do not provide an implementation
// for a given compiler, let the compile fail if it is told to use
// a feature that we cannot live without.

// Keywords added in C11.

// Emulation of C11 _Generic().  Unlike the previously defined C11
// keywords, it is not possible to implement this using exactly the same
// syntax.  Therefore implement something similar under the name
// __generic().  Unlike _Generic(), this macro can only distinguish
// between a single type, so it requires nested invocations to
// distinguish multiple cases.

// C99 Static array indices in function parameter declarations.  Syntax such as:
// void bar(int myArray[static 10]);
// is allowed in C99 but not in C++.  Define __min_size appropriately so
// headers using it can be compiled in either language.  Use like this:
// void bar(int myArray[__min_size(10)]);

// XXX: should use `#if __STDC_VERSION__ < 199901'.

// C++11 exposes a load of C99 stuff

// GCC 2.95 provides `__restrict' as an extension to C90 to support the
// C99-specific `restrict' type qualifier.  We happen to use `__restrict' as
// a way to define the `restrict' type qualifier without disturbing older
// software that is unaware of C99 keywords.

// GNU C version 2.96 adds explicit branch prediction so that
// the CPU back-end can hint the processor and also so that
// code blocks can be reordered such that the predicted path
// sees a more linear flow, thus improving cache behavior, etc.
//
// The following two macros provide us with a way to utilize this
// compiler feature.  Use __predict_true() if you expect the expression
// to evaluate to true, and __predict_false() if you expect the
// expression to evaluate to false.
//
// A few notes about usage:
//
//	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
//	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
//	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
//	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
//
//	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
//	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
//	  make predictions.
//
//	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
//	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
//	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
//	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate
//	  larger code.

// We define this here since <stddef.h>, <sys/queue.h>, and <sys/types.h>
// require it.

// Given the pointer x to the member m of the struct s, return
// a pointer to the containing structure.  When using GCC, we first
// assign pointer x to a local variable, to check that its type is
// compatible with member m.

// Compiler-dependent macros to declare that functions take printf-like
// or scanf-like arguments.  They are null except for versions of gcc
// that are known to support the features properly (old versions of gcc-2
// didn't permit keeping the keywords out of the application namespace).

// Compiler-dependent macros that rely on FreeBSD-specific extensions.

// Embed the rcs id of a source file in the resulting library.  Note that in
// more recent ELF binutils, we use .ident allowing the ID to be stripped.
// Usage:
//	__FBSDID("$FreeBSD$");

// -
// The following definitions are an extension of the behavior originally
// implemented in <sys/_posix.h>, but with a different level of granularity.
// POSIX.1 requires that the macros we test be defined before any standard
// header file is included.
//
// Here's a quick run-down of the versions:
//  defined(_POSIX_SOURCE)		1003.1-1988
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1		1003.1-1990
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2		1003.2-1992 C Language Binding Option
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199309		1003.1b-1993
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199506		1003.1c-1995, 1003.1i-1995,
//					and the omnibus ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112		1003.1-2001
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200809		1003.1-2008
//
// In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX
// Specification, defines a feature-test macro which indicates the version of
// that specification, and which subsumes _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
//
// Our macros begin with two underscores to avoid namespace screwage.

// Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1.

// Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.2-1992, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2.

// Deal with various X/Open Portability Guides and Single UNIX Spec.

// Deal with all versions of POSIX.  The ordering relative to the tests above is
// important.
// -
// Deal with _ANSI_SOURCE:
// If it is defined, and no other compilation environment is explicitly
// requested, then define our internal feature-test macros to zero.  This
// makes no difference to the preprocessor (undefined symbols in preprocessing
// expressions are defined to have value zero), but makes it more convenient for
// a test program to print out the values.
//
// If a program mistakenly defines _ANSI_SOURCE and some other macro such as
// _POSIX_C_SOURCE, we will assume that it wants the broader compilation
// environment (and in fact we will never get here).

// User override __EXT1_VISIBLE

// Old versions of GCC use non-standard ARM arch symbols; acle-compat.h
// translates them to __ARM_ARCH and the modern feature symbols defined by ARM.

// Nullability qualifiers: currently only supported by Clang.

// Type Safety Checking
//
// Clang provides additional attributes to enable checking type safety
// properties that cannot be enforced by the C type system.

// Lock annotations.
//
// Clang provides support for doing basic thread-safety tests at
// compile-time, by marking which locks will/should be held when
// entering/leaving a functions.
//
// Furthermore, it is also possible to annotate variables and structure
// members to enforce that they are only accessed when certain locks are
// held.

// Structure implements a lock.

// Function acquires an exclusive or shared lock.

// Function attempts to acquire an exclusive or shared lock.

// Function releases a lock.

// Function asserts that an exclusive or shared lock is held.

// Function requires that an exclusive or shared lock is or is not held.

// Function should not be analyzed.

// Function or variable should not be sanitized, e.g., by AddressSanitizer.
// GCC has the nosanitize attribute, but as a function attribute only, and
// warns on use as a variable attribute.

// Guard variables and structure members by lock.

// Alignment builtins for better type checking and improved code generation.
// Provide fallback versions for other compilers (GCC/Clang < 10):

// Unusual type definitions.
// rune_t is declared to be an “int” instead of the more natural
// “unsigned long” or “long”.  Two things are happening here.  It is not
// unsigned so that EOF (-1) can be naturally assigned to it and used.  Also,
// it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
// ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
// chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
// ANSI C), but they use __ct_rune_t instead of int.
//
// NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
// be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wint_t and
// rune_t must be the same type.  Also, wint_t should be able to hold all
// members of the largest character set plus one extra value (WEOF), and
// must be at least 16 bits.
