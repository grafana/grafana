## Handle azidentity errors

Any service client method that makes a request to the service may return an error due to authentication failure. This is because the credential authenticates on the first call to the service and on any subsequent call that needs to refresh an access token. Authentication errors include a description of the failure and possibly an error message from Microsoft Entra ID. Depending on the application, these errors may or may not be recoverable.

### Permission issues

Service client errors with a status code of 401 or 403 often indicate that authentication succeeded but the caller doesn't have permission to access the specified API. Check the service documentation to determine which RBAC roles are needed for the request, and ensure the authenticated user or service principal has the appropriate role assignments.

## Find relevant information in errors

Authentication errors can include responses from Microsoft Entra ID and often contain information helpful in diagnosis. Consider the following error message:

```
ClientSecretCredential authentication failed
POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/3c631bb7-a9f7-4343-a5ba-a615913/oauth2/v2.0/token
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE 401 Unauthorized
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
  "error": "invalid_client",
  "error_description": "AADSTS7000215: Invalid client secret provided. Ensure the secret being sent in the request is the client secret value, not the client secret ID, for a secret added to app '86be4c01-505b-45e9-bfc0-9b825fd84'.\r\nTrace ID: 03da4b8e-5ffe-48ca-9754-aff4276f0100\r\nCorrelation ID: 7b12f9bb-2eef-42e3-ad75-eee69ec9088d\r\nTimestamp: 2022-03-02 18:25:26Z",
  "error_codes": [

  ],
  "timestamp": "2022-03-02 18:25:26Z",
  "trace_id": "03da4b8e-5ffe-48ca-9754-aff4276f0100",
  "correlation_id": "7b12f9bb-2eef-42e3-ad75-eee69ec9088d",
  "error_uri": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/error?code=7000215"
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This error contains several pieces of information:

- __Failing Credential Type__: The type of credential that failed to authenticate. This can be helpful when diagnosing issues with chained credential types such as `DefaultAzureCredential` or `ChainedTokenCredential`.

- __Microsoft Entra ID Error Code and Message__: The error code and message returned by Microsoft Entra ID. This can give insight into the specific reason the request failed. For instance, in this case authentication failed because the provided client secret is incorrect. [Microsoft Entra ID documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/reference-error-codes#aadsts-error-codes) has more information on AADSTS error codes.

- __Correlation ID and Timestamp__: The correlation ID and timestamp identify the request in server-side logs. This information can be useful to support engineers diagnosing unexpected Microsoft Entra failures.

### Enable and configure logging

`azidentity` provides the same logging capabilities as the rest of the Azure SDK. The simplest way to see the logs to help debug authentication issues is to print credential logs to the console.
```go
import azlog "github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azcore/log"

// print log output to stdout
azlog.SetListener(func(event azlog.Event, s string) {
    fmt.Println(s)
})

// include only azidentity credential logs
azlog.SetEvents(azidentity.EventAuthentication)
```

#### Verify IMDS is available on the VM

If you have access to the VM, you can use `curl` to verify the managed identity endpoint is available.

```sh
curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.core.windows.net&api-version=2018-02-01' -H "Metadata: true"
```

> This command's output will contain an access token and SHOULD NOT BE SHARED, to avoid compromising account security.

### Azure App Service and Azure Functions managed identity

#### Verify the App Service managed identity endpoint is available

If you can SSH into the App Service, you can verify managed identity is available in the environment. First ensure the environment variables `IDENTITY_ENDPOINT` and `IDENTITY_SECRET` are set. Then you can verify the managed identity endpoint is available using `curl`.

```sh
curl "$IDENTITY_ENDPOINT?resource=https://management.core.windows.net&api-version=2019-08-01" -H "X-IDENTITY-HEADER: $IDENTITY_HEADER"
```

You can get this from the Azure CLI: `az account show --name "[your subscription]" --query "id"`

#### Verify the Azure CLI can obtain tokens

You can manually verify that the Azure CLI can authenticate and obtain tokens. First, use the `account` command to verify the logged in account.

```azurecli
az account show
```

Once you've verified the Azure CLI is using the correct account, you can validate that it's able to obtain tokens for that account.

```azurecli
az account get-access-token --output json --resource https://management.core.windows.net
```

> This command's output will contain an access token and SHOULD NOT BE SHARED, to avoid compromising account security.

You can manually verify that the Azure Developer CLI is properly authenticated and can obtain tokens. First, use the `config` command to verify the account that is currently logged in to the Azure Developer CLI.

```sh
azd config list
```

Once you've verified the Azure Developer CLI is using correct account, you can validate that it's able to obtain tokens for this account.

```sh
azd auth token --output json --scope https://management.core.windows.net/.default
```
>Note that output of this command will contain a valid access token, and SHOULD NOT BE SHARED to avoid compromising account security.

## Troubleshoot persistent token caching issues

### macOS

[azidentity/cache](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity/cache) encrypts persistent caches with the system Keychain on macOS. You may see build and runtime errors there because calling the Keychain API requires cgo and macOS prohibits Keychain access in some scenarios.

#### Build errors

Build errors about undefined `accessor` symbols indicate that cgo wasn't enabled. For example:
```
$ GOOS=darwin go build
# github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity/cache
../../go/pkg/mod/github.com/!azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity/cache@v0.3.0/darwin.go:18:19: undefined: accessor.New
../../go/pkg/mod/github.com/!azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity/cache@v0.3.0/darwin.go:18:38: undefined: accessor.WithAccount
```

Try `go build` again with `CGO_ENABLED=1`. You may need to install native build tools.

#### Runtime errors

macOS prohibits Keychain access from environments without a GUI such as SSH sessions. If your application calls the persistent cache constructor ([cache.New](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity/cache#New)) from an SSH session on a macOS host, you'll see an error like
`persistent storage isn't available due to error "User interaction is not allowed. (-25308)"`. This doesn't mean authentication is impossible, only that credentials can't persist data and the application must reauthenticate the next time it runs.
