    - bodyclose # checks whether HTTP response body is closed successfully [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
    - errcheck # Inspects source code for security problems [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
    - gocritic # The most opinionated Go source code linter [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
    - gocyclo # Computes and checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
    - gofmt # Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification [fast: true, auto-fix: true]
    - goimports # Goimports does everything that gofmt does. Additionally it checks unused imports [fast: true, auto-fix: true]
    - gosec # Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
    - gosimple # Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying a code [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
    - govet # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
    - ineffassign # Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
    - misspell # Finds commonly misspelled English words in comments [fast: true, auto-fix: true]
    - nakedret # Finds naked returns in functions greater than a specified function length [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
    - prealloc # Finds slice declarations that could potentially be preallocated [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
    - revive # Golint differs from gofmt. Gofmt reformats Go source code, whereas golint prints out style mistakes [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
    - staticcheck # Staticcheck is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
    - stylecheck # Stylecheck is a replacement for golint [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
    - typecheck # Like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
    - unconvert # Remove unnecessary type conversions [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
    - unparam # Reports unused function parameters [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
    - unused # Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
