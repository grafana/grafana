    "AddTags": "<p>Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified Amazon SageMaker resource. You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs, models, endpoint configurations, and endpoints. </p> <p>Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. Tag keys must be unique per resource. For more information about tags, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html#allocation-what\">Using Cost Allocation Tags</a> in the <i>AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide</i>. </p>",
    "CreateEndpoint": "<p>Creates an endpoint using the endpoint configuration specified in the request. Amazon SageMaker uses the endpoint to provision resources and deploy models. You create the endpoint configuration with the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_CreateEndpointConfig.html\">CreateEndpointConfig</a> API. </p> <note> <p> Use this API only for hosting models using Amazon SageMaker hosting services. </p> </note> <p>The endpoint name must be unique within an AWS Region in your AWS account. </p> <p>When it receives the request, Amazon SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them. </p> <p>When Amazon SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to <code>Creating</code>. After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to <code>InService</code>. Amazon SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_DescribeEndpoint.html\">DescribeEndpoint</a> API.</p> <p>For an example, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1.html\">Exercise 1: Using the K-Means Algorithm Provided by Amazon SageMaker</a>. </p>",
    "CreateEndpointConfig": "<p>Creates an endpoint configuration that Amazon SageMaker hosting services uses to deploy models. In the configuration, you identify one or more models, created using the <code>CreateModel</code> API, to deploy and the resources that you want Amazon SageMaker to provision. Then you call the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_CreateEndpoint.html\">CreateEndpoint</a> API. </p> <note> <p> Use this API only if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services to deploy models into production. </p> </note> <p>In the request, you define one or more <code>ProductionVariant</code>s, each of which identifies a model. Each <code>ProductionVariant</code> parameter also describes the resources that you want Amazon SageMaker to provision. This includes the number and type of ML compute instances to deploy. </p> <p>If you are hosting multiple models, you also assign a <code>VariantWeight</code> to specify how much traffic you want to allocate to each model. For example, suppose that you want to host two models, A and B, and you assign traffic weight 2 for model A and 1 for model B. Amazon SageMaker distributes two-thirds of the traffic to Model A, and one-third to model B. </p>",
    "CreateModel": "<p>Creates a model in Amazon SageMaker. In the request, you name the model and describe one or more containers. For each container, you specify the docker image containing inference code, artifacts (from prior training), and custom environment map that the inference code uses when you deploy the model into production. </p> <p>Use this API to create a model only if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services. To host your model, you create an endpoint configuration with the <code>CreateEndpointConfig</code> API, and then create an endpoint with the <code>CreateEndpoint</code> API. </p> <p>Amazon SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment. </p> <p>In the <code>CreateModel</code> request, you must define a container with the <code>PrimaryContainer</code> parameter. </p> <p>In the request, you also provide an IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs. For example, if the inference code access any other AWS resources, you grant necessary permissions via this role.</p>",
    "CreateNotebookInstance": "<p>Creates an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. A notebook instance is an ML compute instance running on a Jupyter notebook. </p> <p>In a <code>CreateNotebookInstance</code> request, you specify the type of ML compute instance that you want to run. Amazon SageMaker launches the instance, installs common libraries that you can use to explore datasets for model training, and attaches an ML storage volume to the notebook instance. </p> <p>Amazon SageMaker also provides a set of example notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use Amazon SageMaker with a specific an algorithm or with a machine learning framework. </p> <p>After receiving the request, Amazon SageMaker does the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Creates a network interface in the Amazon SageMaker VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Option) If you specified <code>SubnetId</code>, creates a network interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID that you provide in the input. When creating this network interface, Amazon SageMaker attaches the security group that you specified in the request to the network interface that it creates in your VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in the Amazon SageMaker VPC. If you specified <code>SubnetId</code> of your VPC, Amazon SageMaker specifies both network interfaces when launching this instance. This enables inbound traffic from your own VPC to the notebook instance, assuming that the security groups allow it.</p> </li> </ol> <p>After creating the notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN).</p> <p>After Amazon SageMaker creates the notebook instance, you can connect to the Jupyter server and work in Jupyter notebooks. For example, you can write code to explore a dataset that you can use for model training, train a model, host models by creating Amazon SageMaker endpoints, and validate hosted models. </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works.html\">How It Works</a>. </p>",

The console uses this API to get the URL and show the page. </p>",
    "CreateTrainingJob": "<p> Starts a model training job. After training completes, Amazon SageMaker saves the resulting model artifacts to an Amazon S3 location that you specify. </p> <p>If you choose to host your model using Amazon SageMaker hosting services, you can use the resulting model artifacts as part of the model. You can also use the artifacts in a deep learning service other than Amazon SageMaker, provided that you know how to use them for inferences. </p> <p>In the request body, you provide the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>AlgorithmSpecification</code> - Identifies the training algorithm to use. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>HyperParameters</code> - Specify these algorithm-specific parameters to influence the quality of the final model.

In distributed training, you specify more than one instance. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RoleARN</code> - The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) that Amazon SageMaker assumes to perform tasks on your behalf during model training. You must grant this role the necessary permissions so that Amazon SageMaker can successfully complete model training. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>StoppingCondition</code> - Sets a duration for training.
