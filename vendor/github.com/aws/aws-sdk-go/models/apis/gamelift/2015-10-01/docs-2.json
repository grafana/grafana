    "CreateAlias": "<p>Creates an alias for a fleet. You can use an alias to anonymize your fleet by referencing an alias instead of a specific fleet when you create game sessions. Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. Use a simple alias to point to an active fleet. Use a terminal alias to display a message to incoming traffic instead of routing players to an active fleet. This option is useful when a game server is no longer supported but you want to provide better messaging than a standard 404 error.</p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. To reassign the alias to another fleet ID, call <a>UpdateAlias</a>.</p>",
    "CreateBuild": "<p>Initializes a new build record and generates information required to upload a game build to Amazon GameLift. Once the build record has been created and its status is <code>INITIALIZED</code>, you can upload your game build.</p> <important> <p>Do not use this API action unless you are using your own Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) client and need to manually upload your build files. Instead, to create a build, use the CLI command <code>upload-build</code>, which creates a new build record and uploads the build files in one step. (See the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/\">Amazon GameLift Developer Guide</a> for more details on the CLI and the upload process.) </p> </important> <p>To create a new build, optionally specify a build name and version. This metadata is stored with other properties in the build record and is displayed in the GameLift console (it is not visible to players). If successful, this action returns the newly created build record along with the Amazon S3 storage location and AWS account credentials. Use the location and credentials to upload your game build.</p>",
    "CreateFleet": "<p>Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can run multiple server processes to host game sessions. You configure a fleet to create instances with certain hardware specifications (see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a> for more information), and deploy a specified game build to each instance. A newly created fleet passes through several statuses; once it reaches the <code>ACTIVE</code> status, it can begin hosting game sessions.</p> <p>To create a new fleet, provide a fleet name, an EC2 instance type, and a build ID of the game build to deploy. You can also configure the new fleet with the following settings: (1) a runtime configuration describing what server processes to run on each instance in the fleet (required to create fleet), (2) access permissions for inbound traffic, (3) fleet-wide game session protection, and (4) the location of default log files for GameLift to upload and store.</p> <p>If the <code>CreateFleet</code> call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks:</p> <ul> <li>Creates a fleet record and sets the status to <code>NEW</code> (followed by other statuses as the fleet is activated).</li> <li>Sets the fleet's capacity to 1 \"desired\", which causes GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.</li> <li>Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, GameLift staggers each launch by a few seconds.</li> <li>Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the GameLift console.</li> <li>Sets the fleet's status to <code>ACTIVE</code> once one server process in the fleet is ready to host a game session.</li> </ul> <p>After a fleet is created, use the following actions to change fleet properties and configuration:</p> <ul> <li> <a>UpdateFleetAttributes</a> -- Update fleet metadata, including name and description.</li> <li> <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> -- Increase or decrease the number of instances you want the fleet to maintain.</li> <li> <a>UpdateFleetPortSettings</a> -- Change the IP address and port ranges that allow access to incoming traffic.</li> <li> <a>UpdateRuntimeConfiguration</a> -- Change how server processes are launched in the fleet, including launch path, launch parameters, and the number of concurrent processes.</li> </ul>",
    "CreateGameSession": "<p>Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns the new session to an instance in the specified fleet, which initializes a new server process to host the game session. A fleet must be in an <code>ACTIVE</code> status before a game session can be created in it.</p> <p>To create a game session, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID and indicate the maximum number of players the game session allows. You can also provide a name and a set of properties for your game (optional). If successful, a <a>GameSession</a> object is returned containing session properties, including an IP address.

    "CreatePlayerSessions": "<p>Adds a group of players to a game session. Similar to <a>CreatePlayerSession</a>, this action allows you to add multiple players in a single call, which is useful for games that provide party and/or matchmaking features. A game session must be in an <code>ACTIVE</code> status, have a creation policy of <code>ALLOW_ALL</code>, and have an open player slot before players can be added to the session.</p> <p>To create player sessions, specify a game session ID and a list of player IDs. If successful, the players are added to the game session and a set of new <a>PlayerSession</a> objects is returned. </p>",
    "DeleteAlias": "<p>Deletes an alias. This action removes all record of the alias; game clients attempting to access a server process using the deleted alias receive an error. To delete an alias, specify the alias ID to be deleted.</p>",
    "DeleteBuild": "<p>Deletes a build. This action permanently deletes the build record and any uploaded build files.</p> <p>To delete a build, specify its ID. Deleting a build does not affect the status of any active fleets using the build, but you can no longer create new fleets with the deleted build.</p>",
    "DeleteFleet": "<p>Deletes everything related to a fleet. Before deleting a fleet, you must set the fleet's desired capacity to zero. See <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>.</p> <p>This action removes the fleet's resources and the fleet record. Once a fleet is deleted, you can no longer use that fleet.</p>",

When searching with this attribute, the search value must be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join. </li> </ul> <p>To search or sort, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID, and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a collection of <a>GameSession</a> objects matching the request is returned.</p> <note> <p>Returned values for <code>playerSessionCount</code> and <code>hasAvailablePlayerSessions</code> change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out.

    "UpdateRuntimeConfiguration": "<p>Updates the current runtime configuration for the specified fleet, which tells GameLift how to launch server processes on instances in the fleet. You can update a fleet's runtime configuration at any time after the fleet is created; it does not need to be in an <code>ACTIVE</code> status.</p> <p>To update runtime configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a <code>RuntimeConfiguration</code> object with the updated collection of server process configurations.</p> <p>Each instance in a GameLift fleet checks regularly for an updated runtime configuration and changes how it launches server processes to comply with the latest version. Existing server processes are not affected by the update; they continue to run until they end, while GameLift simply adds new server processes to fit the current runtime configuration. As a result, the runtime configuration changes are applied gradually as existing processes shut down and new processes are launched in GameLift's normal process recycling activity.</p>"
