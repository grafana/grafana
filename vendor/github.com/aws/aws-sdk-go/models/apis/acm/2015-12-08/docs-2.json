  "operations": {
    "AddTagsToCertificate": "<p>Adds one or more tags to an ACM Certificate. Tags are labels that you can use to identify and organize your AWS resources. Each tag consists of a <code>key</code> and an optional <code>value</code>. You specify the certificate on input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You specify the tag by using a key-value pair. </p> <p>You can apply a tag to just one certificate if you want to identify a specific characteristic of that certificate, or you can apply the same tag to multiple certificates if you want to filter for a common relationship among those certificates. Similarly, you can apply the same tag to multiple resources if you want to specify a relationship among those resources. For example, you can add the same tag to an ACM Certificate and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to indicate that they are both used by the same website. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/tags.html\">Tagging ACM Certificates</a>. </p> <p>To remove one or more tags, use the <a>RemoveTagsFromCertificate</a> action. To view all of the tags that have been applied to the certificate, use the <a>ListTagsForCertificate</a> action. </p>",
    "DeleteCertificate": "<p>Deletes a certificate and its associated private key. If this action succeeds, the certificate no longer appears in the list that can be displayed by calling the <a>ListCertificates</a> action or be retrieved by calling the <a>GetCertificate</a> action. The certificate will not be available for use by AWS services integrated with ACM. </p> <note> <p>You cannot delete an ACM Certificate that is being used by another AWS service. To delete a certificate that is in use, the certificate association must first be removed.</p> </note>",
    "DescribeCertificate": "<p>Returns detailed metadata about the specified ACM Certificate.</p>",
    "GetCertificate": "<p>Retrieves a certificate specified by an ARN and its certificate chain . The chain is an ordered list of certificates that contains the end entity ertificate, intermediate certificates of subordinate CAs, and the root certificate in that order. The certificate and certificate chain are base64 encoded. If you want to decode the certificate to see the individual fields, you can use OpenSSL.</p>",
    "ImportCertificate": "<p>Imports a certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to use with services that are integrated with ACM.

However, services integrated with ACM allow only certificate types they support to be associated with their resources. The following guidelines are also important:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing.</p> </li> <li> <p>The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must enter its certificate chain.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain.</p> </li> <li> <p>The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.</p> </li> <li> <p>The current time must be between the <code>Not Before</code> and <code>Not After</code> certificate fields.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>Issuer</code> field must not be empty.</p> </li> <li> <p>The OCSP authority URL must not exceed 1000 characters.</p> </li> <li> <p>To import a new certificate, omit the <code>CertificateArn</code> field. Include this field only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you import a certificate by using the CLI or one of the SDKs, you must specify the certificate, certificate chain, and private key parameters as file names preceded by <code>file://</code>. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the <code>C:\\temp</code> folder as <code>C:\\temp\\certificate_to_import.pem</code>. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these parameters as BLOBs. </p> </li> </ul> <p>This operation returns the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html\">Amazon Resource Name (ARN)</a> of the imported certificate.</p>",
    "ListCertificates": "<p>Retrieves a list of certificate ARNs and domain names. You can request that only certificates that match a specific status be listed. You can also filter by specific attributes of the certificate. </p>",
    "ListTagsForCertificate": "<p>Lists the tags that have been applied to the ACM Certificate. Use the certificate's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify the certificate. To add a tag to an ACM Certificate, use the <a>AddTagsToCertificate</a> action. To delete a tag, use the <a>RemoveTagsFromCertificate</a> action. </p>",
    "RemoveTagsFromCertificate": "<p>Remove one or more tags from an ACM Certificate. A tag consists of a key-value pair. If you do not specify the value portion of the tag when calling this function, the tag will be removed regardless of value. If you specify a value, the tag is removed only if it is associated with the specified value. </p> <p>To add tags to a certificate, use the <a>AddTagsToCertificate</a> action.

    "RequestCertificate": "<p>Requests an ACM Certificate for use with other AWS services.

You can also specify additional FQDNs in the <code>SubjectAlternativeNames</code> parameter if users can reach your site by using other names. </p> <p>For each domain name you specify, email is sent to the domain owner to request approval to issue the certificate.

For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate.html\">Validate Domain Ownership</a>. </p> <p>After receiving approval from the domain owner, the ACM Certificate is issued.

    "ResendValidationEmail": "<p>Resends the email that requests domain ownership validation. The domain owner or an authorized representative must approve the ACM Certificate before it can be issued. The certificate can be approved by clicking a link in the mail to navigate to the Amazon certificate approval website and then clicking <b>I Approve</b>. However, the validation email can be blocked by spam filters. Therefore, if you do not receive the original mail, you can request that the mail be resent within 72 hours of requesting the ACM Certificate. If more than 72 hours have elapsed since your original request or since your last attempt to resend validation mail, you must request a new certificate.
