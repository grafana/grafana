  "service": "<fullname>AWS Cloud9</fullname> <p>AWS Cloud9 is a collection of tools that you can use to code, build, run, test, debug, and release software in the cloud.</p> <p>In the background, these tools are available through development environments running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances (known as <i>Amazon EC2 environments</i>), your own servers (known as <i>SSH environments</i>), or a combination. This enables you to create and switch between multiple environments, with each environment set up for a specific development project.</p> <p>For more information about AWS Cloud9, see the <i>AWS Cloud9 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>AWS Cloud9 supports these operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>CreateEnvironmentEC2</code>: Creates an AWS Cloud9 development environment, launches an Amazon EC2 instance, and then hosts the environment on the instance.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateEnvironmentMembership</code>: Adds an environment member to an environment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteEnvironment</code>: Deletes an environment. If the environment is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance, also terminates the instance.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteEnvironmentMembership</code>: Deletes an environment member from an environment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DescribeEnvironmentMemberships</code>: Gets information about environment members for an environment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DescribeEnvironments</code>: Gets information about environments.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DescribeEnvironmentStatus</code>: Gets status information for an environment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ListEnvironments</code>: Gets a list of environment identifiers.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UpdateEnvironment</code>: Changes the settings of an existing environment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UpdateEnvironmentMembership</code>: Changes the settings of an existing environment member for an environment.</p> </li> </ul>",
