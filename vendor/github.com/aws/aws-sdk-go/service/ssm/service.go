// This is the Amazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM) API Reference. SSM enables
// you to remotely manage the configuration of your Amazon EC2 instances, virtual
// machines (VMs), or servers in your on-premises environment or in an environment
// provided by other cloud providers using scripts, commands, or the Amazon
// EC2 console. SSM includes an on-demand solution called Amazon EC2 Run Command
// and a lightweight instance configuration solution called SSM Config.
//
// This references is intended to be used with the EC2 Run Command User Guide
// for Linux (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/execute-remote-commands.html)
// or Windows (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/execute-remote-commands.html).
//
//  You must register your on-premises servers and VMs through an activation
// process before you can configure them using Run Command. Registered servers
// and VMs are called managed instances. For more information, see Setting Up
// Run Command On Managed Instances (On-Premises Servers and VMs) on Linux (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managed-instances.html)
// or Setting Up Run Command On Managed Instances (On-Premises Servers and VMs)
// on Windows (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/managed-instances.html).
//
//   Run Command
//
// Run Command provides an on-demand experience for executing commands. You
// can use pre-defined SSM documents to perform the actions listed later in
// this section, or you can create your own documents. With these documents,
// you can remotely configure your instances by sending commands using the Commands
// page in the Amazon EC2 console (http://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/), AWS
// Tools for Windows PowerShell (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Amazon_Simple_Systems_Management_cmdlets.html),
// the AWS CLI (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/index.html),
// or AWS SDKs.
//
// Run Command reports the status of the command execution for each instance
// targeted by a command. You can also audit the command execution to understand
// who executed commands, when, and what changes were made. By switching between
// different SSM documents, you can quickly configure your instances with different
// types of commands. To get started with Run Command, verify that your environment
// meets the prerequisites for remotely running commands on EC2 instances (Linux
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/remote-commands-prereq.html)
// or Windows (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/remote-commands-prereq.html)).
//
//   SSM Config
//
// SSM Config is a lightweight instance configuration solution. SSM Config
// is currently only available for Windows instances. With SSM Config, you can
// specify a setup configuration for your instances. SSM Config is similar to
// EC2 User Data, which is another way of running one-time scripts or applying
// settings during instance launch. SSM Config is an extension of this capability.
// Using SSM documents, you can specify which actions the system should perform
// on your instances, including which applications to install, which AWS Directory
// Service directory to join, which Microsoft PowerShell modules to install,
// etc. If an instance is missing one or more of these configurations, the system
// makes those changes. By default, the system checks every five minutes to
// see if there is a new configuration to apply as defined in a new SSM document.
// If so, the system updates the instances accordingly. In this way, you can
// remotely maintain a consistent configuration baseline on your instances.
// SSM Config is available using the AWS CLI or the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell.
// For more information, see Managing Windows Instance Configuration (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-configuration-manage.html).
//
// SSM Config and Run Command include the following pre-defined documents.
//
//  Linux
//
//    AWS-RunShellScript to run shell scripts
//
//    AWS-UpdateSSMAgent to update the Amazon SSM agent
//
//     Windows
//
//    AWS-JoinDirectoryServiceDomain to join an AWS Directory
//
//    AWS-RunPowerShellScript to run PowerShell commands or scripts
//
//    AWS-UpdateEC2Config to update the EC2Config service
//
//    AWS-ConfigureWindowsUpdate to configure Windows Update settings
//
//    AWS-InstallApplication to install, repair, or uninstall software using
// an MSI package
//
//    AWS-InstallPowerShellModule to install PowerShell modules
//
//    AWS-ConfigureCloudWatch to configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor
// applications and systems
//
//    AWS-ListWindowsInventory to collect information about an EC2 instance
// running in Windows.
//
//    AWS-FindWindowsUpdates to scan an instance and determines which updates
// are missing.
//
//    AWS-InstallMissingWindowsUpdates to install missing updates on your EC2
// instance.
//
//    AWS-InstallSpecificWindowsUpdates to install one or more specific updates.
//
//    The commands or scripts specified in SSM documents run with administrative
// privilege on your instances because the Amazon SSM agent runs as root on
// Linux and the EC2Config service runs in the Local System account on Windows.
// If a user has permission to execute any of the pre-defined SSM documents
// (any document that begins with AWS-*) then that user also has administrator
// access to the instance. Delegate access to Run Command and SSM Config judiciously.
// This becomes extremely important if you create your own SSM documents. Amazon
// Web Services does not provide guidance about how to create secure SSM documents.
// You create SSM documents and delegate access to Run Command at your own risk.
// As a security best practice, we recommend that you assign access to "AWS-*"
// documents, especially the AWS-RunShellScript document on Linux and the AWS-RunPowerShellScript
// document on Windows, to trusted administrators only. You can create SSM documents
// for specific tasks and delegate access to non-administrators.
//
//  For information about creating and sharing SSM documents, see the following
// topics in the SSM User Guide:
//
//    Creating SSM Documents (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-ssm-doc.html)
