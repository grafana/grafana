// Creates a delivery stream.
//
//  CreateDeliveryStream is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns.
// The initial status of the delivery stream is CREATING. After the delivery
// stream is created, its status is ACTIVE and it now accepts data. Attempts
// to send data to a delivery stream that is not in the ACTIVE state cause an
// exception. To check the state of a delivery stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream.
//
// The name of a delivery stream identifies it. You can't have two delivery
// streams with the same name in the same region. Two delivery streams in different
// AWS accounts or different regions in the same AWS account can have the same
// name.
//
// By default, you can create up to 20 delivery streams per region.
//
// A delivery stream can only be configured with a single destination, Amazon
// S3, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, or Amazon Redshift. For correct CreateDeliveryStream
// request syntax, specify only one destination configuration parameter: either
// S3DestinationConfiguration, ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration, or RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.
//
// As part of S3DestinationConfiguration, optional values BufferingHints, EncryptionConfiguration,
// and CompressionFormat can be provided. By default, if no BufferingHints value
// is provided, Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever
// condition is satisfied first. Note that BufferingHints is a hint, so there
// are some cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly;
// for example, record boundaries are such that the size is a little over or
// under the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed.
// We strongly recommend that you enable encryption to ensure secure data storage
// in Amazon S3.
//
// A few notes about RedshiftDestinationConfiguration:
//
//   An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location,
// as Firehose first delivers data to S3 and then uses COPY syntax to load data
// into an Amazon Redshift table. This is specified in the RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration
// parameter element.
//
//   The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified in RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration
// because the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket
// doesn't support these compression formats.
//
//   We strongly recommend that the username and password provided is used
// exclusively for Firehose purposes, and that the permissions for the account
// are restricted for Amazon Redshift INSERT permissions.
//
//   Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of destinations.
// The IAM role should allow the Firehose principal to assume the role, and
// the role should have permissions that allows the service to deliver the data.
// For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Access (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3)
// in the Amazon Kinesis Firehose Developer Guide.
