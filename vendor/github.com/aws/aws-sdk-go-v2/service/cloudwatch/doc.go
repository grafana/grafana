// Package cloudwatch provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon CloudWatch.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services)
// resources and the applications you run on Amazon Web Services in real time. You
// can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you
// want to measure for your resources and applications.
//
// CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you
// are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the
// CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use this
// data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle
// increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save
// money.
//
// In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with Amazon Web
// Services, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain
// system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
// operational health.
