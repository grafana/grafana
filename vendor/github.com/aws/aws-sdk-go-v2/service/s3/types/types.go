//     object encrypted with SSE-KMS to a bucket. By default, Amazon S3 uses this KMS
//     key for SSE-KMS.
//
//   - Directory buckets - Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key]per
//     directory bucket's lifetime. The [Amazon Web Services managed key]( aws/s3 ) isn't supported.
//
//   - Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two supported

	//   - General purpose buckets - If you're specifying a customer managed KMS key,
	//   we recommend using a fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias
	//   instead, then KMS resolves the key within the requester’s account. This behavior
	//   can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the
	//   requester, and not the bucket owner. Also, if you use a key ID, you can run into

	//
	//   - Directory buckets - When you specify an [KMS customer managed key]for encryption in your directory
	//   bucket, only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key
