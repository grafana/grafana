// Uploads a part in a multipart upload.
//
// In this operation, you provide new data as a part of an object in your request.
// However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data
// source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object,
// you use the [UploadPartCopy]operation.
//
// You must initiate a multipart upload (see [CreateMultipartUpload]) before you can upload any part. In
// response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique
// identifier that you must include in your upload part request.
//
// Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number
// uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being
// created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with
// a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten.
//
// For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload
// specifications, see [Multipart upload limits]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must
// either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for
// storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart
// upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the
// parts storage.
//
// For more information on multipart uploads, go to [Multipart Upload Overview] in the Amazon S3 User Guide .
//
// Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API
// operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style
// requests in the format
// https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
// . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints
// in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information
// about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// Permissions
//   - General purpose bucket permissions - To perform a multipart upload with
//     encryption using an Key Management Service key, the requester must have
//     permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey actions on the key. The
//     requester must also have permissions for the kms:GenerateDataKey action for
//     the CreateMultipartUpload API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the
//     kms:Decrypt action on the UploadPart and UploadPartCopy APIs.
//
// These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data
//
//	from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more
//	information about KMS permissions, see [Protecting data using server-side encryption with KMS]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For
//	information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart upload and permissions]
//	and [Multipart upload API and permissions]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
//	- Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a
//	directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [CreateSession]CreateSession API operation
//	for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
//	s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy
//	or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on
//	the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
//	header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token
//	expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session
//	token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the
//	session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session
//	expires. For more information about authorization, see [CreateSession]CreateSession .
//
// If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
//
//	kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies
//	and KMS key policies for the KMS key.
//
// Data integrity  General purpose bucket - To ensure that data is not corrupted
// traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part
// request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they
// do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. If the upload request is signed with
// Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the x-amz-content-sha256
// header as a checksum instead of Content-MD5 . For more information see [Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)].
//
// Directory buckets - MD5 is not supported by directory buckets. You can use
// checksum algorithms to check object integrity.
//
// Encryption
//   - General purpose bucket - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
//     rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers
//     and decrypts it when you access it. You have mutually exclusive options to
//     protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you
//     choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options
//     are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and
//     Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side
//     encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally
//     tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption with other
//     key options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys
//     (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key (SSE-C).
//
// Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload operations.
//
//	Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), you don't need
//	to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you
//	only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial
//	Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see [CreateMultipartUpload].
//
// If you request server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key
//
//	(SSE-C) in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical
//	encryption information in each part upload using the following request headers.
//
//	- x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
//
//	- x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
//
//	- x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
//
// For more information, see [Using Server-Side Encryption]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
//   - Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two supported
//     options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3
//     managed keys (SSE-S3) ( AES256 ) and server-side encryption with KMS keys
//     (SSE-KMS) ( aws:kms ).
//
// Special errors
//
//   - Error Code: NoSuchUpload
//
//   - Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID
//     might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.
//
