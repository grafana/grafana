// End of support notice: Beginning October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 will discontinue
// support for creating new Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACL). Email Grantee
// ACLs created prior to this date will continue to work and remain accessible
// through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, Command Line Interface
// (CLI), SDKs, and REST API. However, you will no longer be able to create new
// Email Grantee ACLs.
//
// This change affects the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (N.
// Virginia) Region, US West (N. California) Region, US West (Oregon) Region, Asia
// Pacific (Singapore) Region, Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region, Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
// Region, Europe (Ireland) Region, and South America (São Paulo) Region.
//
// This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload
// ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You
// specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see [UploadPart]).
// You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort
// the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see [Multipart Upload Overview]
// in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop
// being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort
// the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and
// stops charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a
// multipart upload.
//
// If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads,
// the created multipart upload must be completed within the number of days
// specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete
// multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the
// multipart upload. For more information, see [Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Configuration].
//
//   - Directory buckets - S3 Lifecycle is not supported by directory buckets.
//
//   - Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this
//     API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support
//     virtual-hosted-style requests in the format
//     https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
//     . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints
//     in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information
//     about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// Request signing For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of
// regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to
// upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each
// request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload
// requests. For more information about signing, see [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// Permissions
//
//   - General purpose bucket permissions - To perform a multipart upload with
//     encryption using an Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key, the requester must
//     have permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey actions on the key.
//     The requester must also have permissions for the kms:GenerateDataKey action
//     for the CreateMultipartUpload API. Then, the requester needs permissions for
//     the kms:Decrypt action on the UploadPart and UploadPartCopy APIs. These
//     permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the
//     encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more
//     information, see [Multipart upload API and permissions]and [Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
//   - Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a
//     directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [CreateSession]CreateSession API operation
//     for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the
//     s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy
//     or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on
//     the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
//     header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token
//     expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session
//     token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the
//     session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session
//     expires. For more information about authorization, see [CreateSession]CreateSession .
//
// Encryption
//
//   - General purpose buckets - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
//     rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers
//     and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new
//     objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you
//     don't specify encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of
//     the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption configuration of the
//     destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption
//     configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys
//     (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that
//     uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS),
//     or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding
//     KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you
//     perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type
//     of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3
//     encrypts the object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3
//     managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the encryption setting
//     in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the
//     destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If
//     you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide
//     in [UploadPart]and [UploadPartCopy]requests must match the headers you used in the CreateMultipartUpload
//     request.
//
//   - Use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) that include the Amazon Web Services managed key (
//     aws/s3 ) and KMS customer managed keys stored in Key Management Service (KMS)
//     – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
//     specify the following headers in the request.
//
//   - x-amz-server-side-encryption
//
//   - x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id
//
//   - x-amz-server-side-encryption-context
//
//   - If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms , but don't provide
//     x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id , Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web
//     Services managed key ( aws/s3 key) in KMS to protect the data.
//
//   - To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web
//     Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and
//     kms:GenerateDataKey* actions on the key. These permissions are required
//     because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts
//     before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see [Multipart upload API and permissions]and [Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS]in
//     the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
//   - If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same
//     Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions
//     on the key policy. If your IAM user or role is in a different account from the
//     key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user
//     or role.
//
//   - All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by KMS fail if you don't
//     make them by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS),
//     or Signature Version 4. For information about configuring any of the officially
//     supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see [Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication]in the
//     Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
// For more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys]
//
//	in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
//	- Use customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) – If you want to manage your
//	own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.
//
//	- x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
//
//	- x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
//
//	- x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
//
// For more information about server-side encryption with customer-provided
//
//	encryption keys (SSE-C), see [Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)]in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
//
//	- Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two supported
//	options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3
//	managed keys (SSE-S3) ( AES256 ) and server-side encryption with KMS keys
//	(SSE-KMS) ( aws:kms ). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses
//	the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default
//	encryption in your CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new
//	objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For
//	more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about
//	the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads].
//
// In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject]and [UploadPartCopy]) using the REST API, the
//
//	encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified
//	in the CreateSession request. You can't override the values of the encryption
//	settings ( x-amz-server-side-encryption ,
//	x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id ,
//	x-amz-server-side-encryption-context , and
//	x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled ) that are specified in the
//	CreateSession request. You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption
//	settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the
//	encryption settings values from the CreateSession request to protect new
//	objects in the directory bucket.
//
// When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for CreateSession , the
//
//	session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a
//	session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's
//	default encryption configuration for the CreateSession request. It's not
//	supported to override the encryption settings values in the CreateSession
//	request. So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject]and [UploadPartCopy]), the encryption
//	request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory
//	bucket.
//
// For directory buckets, when you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation and an
//
//	UploadPartCopy operation, the request headers you provide in the
//	CreateMultipartUpload request must match the default encryption configuration
//	of the destination bucket.

	SSEKMSKeyId *string

	// The server-side encryption algorithm used when you store this object in Amazon

	//
	//   - Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two supported
	//   options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3
	//   managed keys (SSE-S3) ( AES256 ) and server-side encryption with KMS keys
	//   (SSE-KMS) ( aws:kms ). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses
	//   the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default
	//   encryption in your CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new
	//   objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For
	//   more information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption]in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about
	//   the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads].
	//
	// In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject]and [UploadPartCopy]) using the REST API, the
	//   encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified
	//   in the CreateSession request. You can't override the values of the encryption
	//   settings ( x-amz-server-side-encryption ,
	//   x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id ,
	//   x-amz-server-side-encryption-context , and
	//   x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled ) that are specified in the
	//   CreateSession request. You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption
	//   settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the
	//   encryption settings values from the CreateSession request to protect new
	//   objects in the directory bucket.
	//
	// When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for CreateSession , the
	//   session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a
	//   session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's
	//   default encryption configuration for the CreateSession request. It's not
	//   supported to override the encryption settings values in the CreateSession
	//   request. So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject]and [UploadPartCopy]), the encryption
	//   request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory
	//   bucket.
	//
	//   - S3 access points for Amazon FSx - When accessing data stored in Amazon FSx
	//   file systems using S3 access points, the only valid server side encryption
	//   option is aws:fsx . All Amazon FSx file systems have encryption configured by
	//   default and are encrypted at rest. Data is automatically encrypted before being
	//   written to the file system, and automatically decrypted as it is read. These
	//   processes are handled transparently by Amazon FSx.
