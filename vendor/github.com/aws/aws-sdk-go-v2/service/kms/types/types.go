	// Describes the connection error. This field appears in the response only when

	//
	// Many failures can be resolved by updating the properties of the custom key

	// and try to connect again (ConnectCustomKeyStore ). For additional help resolving these errors, see [How to Fix a Connection Failure]
	// in Key Management Service Developer Guide.
	//
	// All custom key stores:
	//
	//   - INTERNAL_ERROR — KMS could not complete the request due to an internal
	//   error. Retry the request. For ConnectCustomKeyStore requests, disconnect the
	//   custom key store before trying to connect again.
	//
	//   - NETWORK_ERRORS — Network errors are preventing KMS from connecting the
	//   custom key store to its backing key store.
	//
	// CloudHSM key stores:
	//
	//   - CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND — KMS cannot find the CloudHSM cluster with the specified
	//   cluster ID.
	//
	//   - INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS — The associated CloudHSM cluster does not
	//   contain any active HSMs. To connect a custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster,
	//   the cluster must contain at least one active HSM.
	//
	//   - INSUFFICIENT_FREE_ADDRESSES_IN_SUBNET — At least one private subnet
	//   associated with the CloudHSM cluster doesn't have any available IP addresses. A
	//   CloudHSM key store connection requires one free IP address in each of the
	//   associated private subnets, although two are preferable. For details, see [How to Fix a Connection Failure]in
	//   the Key Management Service Developer Guide.
	//
	//   - INVALID_CREDENTIALS — The KeyStorePassword for the custom key store doesn't
	//   match the current password of the kmsuser crypto user in the CloudHSM cluster.
	//   Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must
	//   change the kmsuser account password and update the KeyStorePassword value for
	//   the custom key store.
	//
	//   - SUBNET_NOT_FOUND — A subnet in the CloudHSM cluster configuration was
	//   deleted. If KMS cannot find all of the subnets in the cluster configuration,
	//   attempts to connect the custom key store to the CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix
	//   this error, create a cluster from a recent backup and associate it with your
	//   custom key store. (This process creates a new cluster configuration with a VPC
	//   and private subnets.) For details, see [How to Fix a Connection Failure]in the Key Management Service
	//   Developer Guide.
	//
	//   - USER_LOCKED_OUT — The kmsuser CU account is locked out of the associated
	//   CloudHSM cluster due to too many failed password attempts. Before you can
	//   connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the
	//   kmsuser account password and update the key store password value for the
	//   custom key store.
	//
	//   - USER_LOGGED_IN — The kmsuser CU account is logged into the associated
	//   CloudHSM cluster. This prevents KMS from rotating the kmsuser account password
	//   and logging into the cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to
	//   its CloudHSM cluster, you must log the kmsuser CU out of the cluster. If you
	//   changed the kmsuser password to log into the cluster, you must also and update
	//   the key store password value for the custom key store. For help, see [How to Log Out and Reconnect]in the
	//   Key Management Service Developer Guide.
	//
	//   - USER_NOT_FOUND — KMS cannot find a kmsuser CU account in the associated
	//   CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM
	//   cluster, you must create a kmsuser CU account in the cluster, and then update
	//   the key store password value for the custom key store.
	//
	// External key stores:
	//
	//   - INVALID_CREDENTIALS — One or both of the XksProxyAuthenticationCredential
	//   values is not valid on the specified external key store proxy.
	//
	//   - XKS_PROXY_ACCESS_DENIED — KMS requests are denied access to the external key
	//   store proxy. If the external key store proxy has authorization rules, verify
	//   that they permit KMS to communicate with the proxy on your behalf.
	//
	//   - XKS_PROXY_INVALID_CONFIGURATION — A configuration error is preventing the
	//   external key store from connecting to its proxy. Verify the value of the
	//   XksProxyUriPath .
	//
	//   - XKS_PROXY_INVALID_RESPONSE — KMS cannot interpret the response from the
	//   external key store proxy. If you see this connection error code repeatedly,
	//   notify your external key store proxy vendor.
	//
	//   - XKS_PROXY_INVALID_TLS_CONFIGURATION — KMS cannot connect to the external key
	//   store proxy because the TLS configuration is invalid. Verify that the XKS proxy
	//   supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3. Also, verify that the TLS certificate is not expired,
	//   and that it matches the hostname in the XksProxyUriEndpoint value, and that it
	//   is signed by a certificate authority included in the [Trusted Certificate Authorities]list.
	//
	//   - XKS_PROXY_NOT_REACHABLE — KMS can't communicate with your external key store
	//   proxy. Verify that the XksProxyUriEndpoint and XksProxyUriPath are correct.
	//   Use the tools for your external key store proxy to verify that the proxy is
	//   active and available on its network. Also, verify that your external key manager
	//   instances are operating properly. Connection attempts fail with this connection
	//   error code if the proxy reports that all external key manager instances are
	//   unavailable.
	//
	//   - XKS_PROXY_TIMED_OUT — KMS can connect to the external key store proxy, but
	//   the proxy does not respond to KMS in the time allotted. If you see this
	//   connection error code repeatedly, notify your external key store proxy vendor.
	//
	//   - XKS_VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_INVALID_CONFIGURATION — The Amazon VPC endpoint
	//   service configuration doesn't conform to the requirements for an KMS external
	//   key store.
	//
	//   - The VPC endpoint service must be an endpoint service for interface
	//   endpoints in the caller's Amazon Web Services account.
	//
	//   - It must have a network load balancer (NLB) connected to at least two
	//   subnets, each in a different Availability Zone.
	//
	//   - The Allow principals list must include the KMS service principal for the
	//   Region, cks.kms..amazonaws.com , such as cks.kms.us-east-1.amazonaws.com .
	//
	//   - It must not require [acceptance]of connection requests.
	//
	//   - It must have a private DNS name. The private DNS name for an external key
	//   store with VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE connectivity must be unique in its Amazon Web
	//   Services Region.
	//
	//   - The domain of the private DNS name must have a [verification status]of verified .
	//
	//   - The [TLS certificate]specifies the private DNS hostname at which the endpoint is reachable.
	//
	//   - XKS_VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_NOT_FOUND — KMS can't find the VPC endpoint service
	//   that it uses to communicate with the external key store proxy. Verify that the
	//   XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName is correct and the KMS service principal has
	//   service consumer permissions on the Amazon VPC endpoint service.
