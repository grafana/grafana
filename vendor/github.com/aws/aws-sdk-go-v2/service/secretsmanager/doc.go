// Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a

// account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information
// that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the
// requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was
// made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support
// for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see [Logging Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail]in the Amazon Web Services Secrets
// Manager User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including enabling it and
// find your log files, see the [Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide].
