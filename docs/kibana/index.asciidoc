= Kibana

// Why can't I have a preamble here?

== Introduction

Kibana is an open source (Apache Licensed), browser based analytics and search dashboard for
ElasticSearch. Kibana is a snap to setup and start using. Written entirely in HTML and Javascript
it requires only a plain webserver, Kibana requires no fancy server side components.
Kibana strives to be easy to get started with, while also being flexible and powerful, just like
Elasticsearch.
