# Add a title and description to a panel

Add a title and description to a panel to share with users any important information about the visualization. For example, use the description to document the purpose of the visualization.

## Before you begin:

- [Add a panel to a dashboard]({{< relref "../working-with-panels/add-panel.md" >}}).

**To add a title and description to a panel**:

1. Open a panel.

1. In the panel display options pane, locate the **Panel options** section.

1. Enter a **Title**.

   Text entered in this field is displayed at the top of your panel in the panel editor and in the dashboard.

   You can use [variables you have defined]({{< relref "../../variables/_index.md" >}}) in either field, but not [global variables]({{< relref "../../variables/variable-types/global-variables.md" >}}).

1. Write a description of the panel and the data you are displaying.

   Text entered in this field is displayed in a tooltip in the upper left corner of the panel.

   You can use [variables you have defined]({{< relref "../../variables/_index.md" >}}) in either field, but not [global variables]({{< relref "../../variables/variable-types/global-variables.md" >}}).
