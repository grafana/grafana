# Graph time series as points

> **Note:** This is a beta feature. Time series panel is going to replace the Graph panel in the future releases.

This section explains how to use Time series field options to visualize time series data as points and illustrates what the options do.

## Create the panel

1. [Add a panel]({{< relref "../../add-a-panel.md" >}}). Select the [Time series]({{< relref "_index.md" >}}) visualization.
1. In the [Panel editor]({{< relref "../../panel-editor.md" >}}), click the **Field** tab..
1. In Style, click **Points**.

## Style the points

Use the following field settings to refine your visualization.

Some field options will not affect the visualization until you click outside of the field option box you are editing or press Enter.

### Point size
