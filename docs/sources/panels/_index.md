# About Grafana panels

The _panel_ is the basic visualization building block in Grafana. Each panel has a query editor specific to the data source selected in the panel. The query editor allows you to extract the perfect visualization to display on the panel.

There are a wide variety of styling and formatting options for each panel. Panels can be dragged and dropped and rearranged on the dashboard. They can also be resized.

Before you begin, ensure that you have configured a data source. For more information about data sources, refer to [Data Sources]({{< relref "../datasources" >}}).
