# Delete a threshold

Delete a threshold when it is no longer relevant to your business operations. When you delete a threshold, the system removes the threshold from all visualizations that include the threshold.

## Before you begin

- [Add a threshold]({{< relref "./add-a-threshold.md" >}}).

**To delete a threshold**:

1. Navigate to the panel to which you want to add a threshold.
1. Click the **Field** tab. (Or **Panel** tab for a graph panel.)
1. Click the trash can icon next to the threshold you want to remove.
1. Click **Save** to save the changes in the dashboard.
