# About repeating panels and rows

You can configure Grafana to dynamically add panels or rows to a dashboard. A dynamic panel (or row) is a panel that the system creates based on the value of a variable. Variables dynamically change your queries across all panels in a dashboard.

## Grafana Play examples

You can see examples in the following dashboards:

- [Prometheus repeat](https://play.grafana.org/d/000000036/prometheus-repeat)
- [Repeated Rows Dashboard](https://play.grafana.org/d/000000153/repeat-rows).
