## Technical notes

### OAuth role mapping enforcement

This change impacts `GitHub` OAuth, `Gitlab` OAuth, `Okta` OAuth, and `Generic` OAuth.

Previously, if no organization role mapping was found for a user when they connected using OAuth, Grafana didn't update the userâ€™s organization role.

With Grafana 10.1, on every login, if the `role_attribute_path` property doesn't return a role, then the user is assigned the role specified by the `auto_assign_org_role` option or the default role for the organization, which is Viewer by default.

To avoid overriding manually set roles, enable the `skip_org_role_sync` option in the Grafana configuration for your OAuth provider before upgrading to Grafana 10.1 and before users log in for the first time on Grafana 10.1.

Example for Generic OAuth2:

```ini
[auth.generic_oauth]
...
skip_org_role_sync = true
```
