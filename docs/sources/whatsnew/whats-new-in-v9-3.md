# What’s new in Grafana v9.3 (Beta)

Welcome to Grafana v9.3. If you’d prefer to dig into the details, check out the complete [changelog](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's New feature template

Use this template to add your what's new section.

[Generally available | Available in experimental/beta] in Grafana [Open Source, Enterprise, Cloud Free, Cloud Pro, Cloud Advanced]

Description. Include an overview of the feature and problem it solves, and where to learn more (like a link to the docs).

Add a screenshot to this enablement material folder and link to it here.

## Public Dashboards - Audit Table

Available in experimental in Grafana Open Source, Enterprise, Cloud Pro, Cloud Advanced

We have a new feature as part of our Public Dashboard efforts. We have introduced a new menu item under Dashboards → Public Dashboards. This new view is a list of all of the public dashboards in your Grafana instance. From here you can navigate to the underlying dashboard, see if it is enabled, get a quick link out to the public version of the dashboard, or get quick access to the configuration. You will be able to see a dashboard if you have view access, you will be able to navigate to the configuration if you have public dashboard privileges (RBAC “Dashboard Public” or ADMIN basic).

## Public Dashboards - Annotations

Available in experimental in Grafana Open Source, Enterprise, Cloud Pro, Cloud Advanced

Annotations are now supported in public dashboards, with the exception of query annotations. They are turned off by default, but can be turned on in the public dashboard settings modal.

## Transformations - Partition by values

Available in experimental in Grafana Open Source, Enterprise, Cloud Pro, Cloud Advanced

This new transformation can help eliminate the need for multiple queries to the same datasource with different WHERE clauses when graphing multiple series. Consider a metrics SQL table with the following data:

| Time                | Region | Value |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| 2022-10-20 12:00:00 | US     | 1520  |
| 2022-10-20 12:00:00 | EU     | 2936  |
| 2022-10-20 01:00:00 | US     | 1327  |
| 2022-10-20 01:00:00 | EU     | 912   |

Prior to v9.3. if you wanted to plot a red trendline for US and a blue one for EU in the same TimeSeries panel, you would likely have to split this into two queries:

```
   SELECT Time, Value FROM metrics WHERE Time > ‘2022-10-20’ AND Region=’US’
   SELECT Time, Value FROM metrics WHERE Time > ‘2022-10-20’ AND Region=’EU’
```

This also requires you to know ahead of time which regions actually exist in the metrics table.

With the Partition by values transformer, you can now issue a single query and split the results by unique (enum) values from one or more columns (fields) of your choosing. In this case, Region.

```
   SELECT Time, Region, Value FROM metrics WHERE Time > ‘2022-10-20’
```

| Time                | Region | Value |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| 2022-10-20 12:00:00 | US     | 1520  |
| 2022-10-20 01:00:00 | US     | 1327  |

| Time                | Region | Value |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| 2022-10-20 12:00:00 | EU     | 2936  |
| 2022-10-20 01:00:00 | EU     | 912   |
