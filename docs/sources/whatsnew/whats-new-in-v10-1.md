## Dashboards and visualizations

### Disconnect values in time series, trend, and state timeline visualizations

_Generally available in all editions of Grafana._

<!-- Nathan Marrs -->

You can now choose whether to set a threshold above which values in the data should be disconnected. This can be useful in cases where you have sensors that report a value at a set interval, but you want to disconnect the values when the sensor does not respond. This feature complements the existing [connect null values functionality]({{< relref "../panels-visualizations/visualizations/time-series/#connect-null-values" >}}).

To learn more, refer to our [disconnect values documentation]({{< relref "../panels-visualizations/visualizations/time-series/#disconnect-values" >}}).

## Authentication: Configure refresh token handling separately for OAuth providers

<!-- Mihaly Gyongyosi -->

_Available in public preview in all editions of Grafana._

With Grafana v9.3 we introduced a feature toggle called `accessTokenExpirationCheck` to improve the security of Grafana by checking the expiration of the access token and automatically refreshing the expired access token when the user is logged in using one of the OAuth providers.

With the current release, we introduce a new configuration option for each OAuth provider called `use_refresh_token` that allows you to configure whether the particular OAuth integration should use refresh tokens to automatically refresh the access tokens when it expires. Besides, to further improve the security and provide secure defaults we enabled `use_refresh_token` by default for providers that either support refresh tokens by default or fetching refresh tokens is controlled by the client. It is enabled by default for the following OAuth providers: `AzureAD`, `GitLab`, `Google`.

For more information on how to setup refresh token handling, please refer to [the documentation of the particular OAuth provider.]({{< relref "../setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/" >}}).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
The `use_refresh_token` configuration must be used in conjunction with the `accessTokenExpirationCheck` feature toggle. If you disable the `accessTokenExpirationCheck` feature toggle, Grafana will not check the expiration of the access token and will not automatically refresh the expired access token, even if the `use_refresh_token` configuration is set to `true`.

The `accessTokenExpirationCheck` feature toggle will be removed in Grafana v10.2.
