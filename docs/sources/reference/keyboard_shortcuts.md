# Keyboard Shortcuts

No mouse? No problem. Grafana has extensive keyboard shortcuts to allow you to navigate throughout the interface. This comes in especially handy when dealing with dealing with single-purpose machines powering on-wall displays that may not have a mouse available.

## Dashboard Keyboard Shortcuts

Press `Shift`+`?` to open the keyboard shortcut dialog from anywhere within the dashboard views.

|Shortcut|Action|
|---|---|
|`Esc`|Exit fullscreen edit/view mode, close search or any editor view|
|`CTRL`+`F`|Open dashboard search view (also contains import/playlist controls)|
|`CTRL`+`S`|Save dashboard|
|`CTRL`+`H`|Hide row controls|
|`CTRL`+`Z`|Zoom out|
|`CTRL`+`R`|Refresh (Fetches new data and rerenders panels)|
|`CTRL`+`O`|Enable/Disable shared graph crosshair|



**Note**: Grafana keyboard shortcuts are the same across operating system. For example, `CTRL`+`F` will open the dashboard picker on a Mac as well, **not** `⌘`+`F`
