title: Tooltip options
comments: |
  There are two tooltip shared files, tooltip-options-1.md and tooltip-options-2.md, to cover the most common combinations of options. 
  Using two shared files ensures that content remains consistent across visualizations that share the same options and users don't have to figure out which options apply to a specific visualization when reading that content. 
  This file is used in the following visualizations: bar chart, histogram, pie chart, state timeline, status history

Tooltip options control the information overlay that appears when you hover over data points in the visualization.

### Tooltip mode

When you hover your cursor over the visualization, Grafana can display tooltips. Choose how tooltips behave.

- **Single -** The hover tooltip shows only a single series, the one that you are hovering over on the visualization.
- **All -** The hover tooltip shows all series in the visualization. Grafana highlights the series that you are hovering over in bold in the series list in the tooltip.
- **Hidden -** Do not display the tooltip when you interact with the visualization.

Use an override to hide individual series from the tooltip.

### Values sort order

When you set the **Tooltip mode** to **All**, the **Values sort order** option is displayed. This option controls the order in which values are listed in a tooltip. Choose from the following:

- **None** - Grafana automatically sorts the values displayed in a tooltip.
- **Ascending** - Values in the tooltip are listed from smallest to largest.
- **Descending** - Values in the tooltip are listed from largest to smallest.

### Max width

Set the maximum width of the tooltip box.

### Max height

Set the maximum height of the tooltip box. The default is 600 pixels.
