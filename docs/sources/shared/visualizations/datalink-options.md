Data links allow you to link to other panels, dashboards, and external resources while maintaining the context of the source panel. You can create links that include the series name or even the value under the cursor.

For each data link, set the following options:

- **Title**
- **URL**
- **Open in new tab**

To learn more, refer to [Configure data links and actions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/panels-visualizations/configure-data-links/).
