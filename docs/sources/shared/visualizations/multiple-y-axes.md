# Multiple y-axes

In some cases, you might want to display multiple y-axes. For example, if you have a dataset showing both temperature and humidity over time, you might want to show two y-axes with different units for the two series.

You can configure multiple y-axes and control where they're displayed in the visualization by adding field overrides. [This example of a dataset that includes temperature and humidity](../../configure-overrides/#example-2-format-temperature-and-humidity) describes how you can configure that. Repeat the steps for every y-axis you wish to display.
