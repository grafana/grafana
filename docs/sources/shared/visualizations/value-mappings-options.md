Value mapping is a technique you can use to change how data appears in a visualization.

For each value mapping, set the following options:

- **Condition** - Choose what's mapped to the display text and (optionally) color:
  - **Value** - Specific values
  - **Range** - Numerical ranges
  - **Regex** - Regular expressions
  - **Special** - Special values like `Null`, `NaN` (not a number), or boolean values like `true` and `false`
- **Display text**
- **Color** (Optional)
- **Icon** (Canvas only)
