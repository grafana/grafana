You can pan the panel time range left and right, which in turn, changes the dashboard time range.

**Pan** - Click and drag the x-axis area of the panel to pan the time range.

The time range shifts by the distance you drag.
For example, if the original time range is from 9:00 to 9:59 and you drag 30 minutes to the right, the time range changes to 9:30 to 10:29.

For screen recordings showing this interaction, refer to the [Panel overview documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/visualizations/panels-visualizations/panel-overview/#pan-panel-time-range).
