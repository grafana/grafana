### Zoom out

Double-click anywhere on the panel to zoom out the time range.

The range doubles with each double-click, adding equal time to each side of the range.
For example, if the original time range is from 9:00 to 9:59, the time range changes as follow with each double-click:

- Next range: 8:30 - 10:29
- Next range: 7:30 - 11:29

The following screen recording demonstrates the preceding example:
