comments: |
  This file is used in the following visualizations: time series.

You can zoom the panel time range in and out, which in turn, changes the dashboard time range.

**Zoom in** - Click and drag on the panel to zoom in on a particular time range.

**Zoom out** - Double-click anywhere on the panel to zoom out the time range.

When you zoom out, the range doubles with each double-click, adding equal time to each side of the range.
For example, if the original time range is from 9:00 to 9:59, the time range changes as follow with each double-click:

- Next range: 8:30 - 10:29
- Next range: 7:30 - 11:29

For screen recordings showing these interactions, refer to the [Panel overview documentation](https://grafana.com/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/visualizations/panels-visualizations/panel-overview/#zoom-panel-time-range).
