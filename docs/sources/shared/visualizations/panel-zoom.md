You can zoom the panel time range in and out, which in turn, changes the dashboard time range.

[Zoom in](#zoom-in): Click and drag on a panel to zoom in on a particular time range.
[Zoom out](#zoom-out): Double-click to zoom out the panel time range.

## Zoom in

The following screen recording shows the panel time range being zoomed in:

## Zoom out

The range doubles with each double-click adding equal time to each side of the range.
For example, if the original time range is from 9:00 to 9:59, the time range changes as follow with each click:

- Next range: 8:30 - 10:29
- Next range: 7:30 - 11:29

The following screen recording demonstrates the preceding example:
