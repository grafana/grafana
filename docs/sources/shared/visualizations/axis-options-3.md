title: Axis options
comments: |
  There are three axis options shared files, axis-options-1.md, axis-options-2.md, and axis-options-3.md to cover the most common combinations of options. 
  Using shared files ensures that content remains consistent across visualizations that share the same options and users don't have to figure out which options apply to a specific visualization when reading that content.
  This file is used in the following visualizations: state timeline, status history.

| Option    | Description                                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Placement | Control the visibility of series names along the y-axis or time values along the x-axis.         |
| Width     | Set a fixed width for the axis. By default, Grafana dynamically calculates the width of an axis. |
