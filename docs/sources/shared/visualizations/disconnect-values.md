### Disconnect values

Choose whether to set a threshold above which values in the data should be disconnected.

- **Never** - Time series data points in the data are never disconnected.
- **Threshold** - Specify a threshold above which values in the data are disconnected. This can be useful when desired values in the data are of a known size and/or within a known range, and values outside this range should no longer be connected.
