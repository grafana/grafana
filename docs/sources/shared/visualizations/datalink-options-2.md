Data links allow you to link to other panels, dashboards, and external resources while maintaining the context of the source panel. You can create links that include the series name or even the value under the cursor.

For each data link, set the following options:

- **Title**
- **URL**
- **Open in new tab**
- **One click** - Opens the data link with a single click. Only one data link can have **One click** enabled at a time.

To learn more, refer to [Configure data links](../../configure-data-links/).
