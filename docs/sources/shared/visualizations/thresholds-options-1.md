title: Thresholds options
comments: |
  There are two thresholds shared files, thresholds-options-1.md and thresholds-options-2.md, to cover the most common combinations of options. 
  Using two shared files ensures that content remains consistent across visualizations that share the same options and users don't have to figure out which options apply to a specific visualization when reading that content. 
  This file is used in the following visualizations: bar chart, candlestick, time series, trend

A threshold is a value or limit you set for a metric that’s reflected visually when it’s met or exceeded. Thresholds are one way you can conditionally style and color your visualizations based on query results.

For each threshold, set the following options:

| Option          | Description                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Value           | Set the value for each threshold.                                                    |
| Thresholds mode | Choose from **Absolute** and **Percentage**.                                         |
| Show thresholds | Choose from a variety of display options including not displaying thresholds at all. |
