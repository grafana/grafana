**Standard options** in the panel editor pane let you change how field data is displayed in your visualizations. When you set a standard option, the change is applied to all fields or series. For more granular control over the display of fields, refer to [Configure overrides](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/panels-visualizations/configure-overrides/).

| Option        | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit          | Choose which unit a field should use.                                                                                                             |
| Min/Max       | Set the minimum and maximum values used in percentage threshold calculations or leave these field empty for them to be calculated automatically.  |
| Field min/max | Enable **Field min/max** to have Grafana calculate the min or max of each field individually, based on the minimum or maximum value of the field. |
| Decimals      | Specify the number of decimals Grafana includes in the rendered value.                                                                            |
| Display name  | Set the display title of all fields. You can use variables in the field title.                                                                    |
| Color scheme  | Set single or multiple colors for your entire visualization.                                                                                      |
| No value      | Enter what Grafana should display if the field value is empty or null. The default value is a hyphen (-).                                         |
