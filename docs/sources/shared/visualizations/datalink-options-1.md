For each data link, set the following options:

- **Title**
- **URL**
- **Open in new tab**

Data links for this visualization don't include the **One click** switch, however, if there's only one data link configured, that data link has single-click functionality.
If multiple data links are configured, then clicking the visualization opens a menu that displays all the data links.
