Data links allow you to link to other panels, dashboards, and external resources while maintaining the context of the source panel.
You can create links that include the series name or even the value under the cursor.
To learn more, refer to [Configure data links](../../configure-data-links/).

For each data link, set the following options:

- **Title**
- **URL**
- **Open in new tab**

Data links for this visualization don't include the **One click** switch, however, if there's only one data link configured, that data link has single-click functionality. If multiple data links are configured, then clicking the visualization opens a menu that displays all the data links.
