### Tooltip mode

When you hover your cursor over the visualization, Grafana can display tooltips. Choose how tooltips behave.

- **Single -** The hover tooltip shows only a single series, the one that you are hovering over on the visualization.
- **All -** The hover tooltip shows all series in the visualization. Grafana highlights the series that you are hovering over in bold in the series list in the tooltip.
- **Hidden -** Do not display the tooltip when you interact with the visualization.

Use an override to hide individual series from the tooltip.
