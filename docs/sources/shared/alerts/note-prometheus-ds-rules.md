title: 'Note Prometheus data source-managed rules'
---

> Rules from a Prometheus data source appear in the **Data source-managed** section of the **Alert rules** page when [Manage alerts via Alerting UI](ref:shared-configure-prometheus-data-source-alerting) is enabled.
>
> However, Grafana can only create and edit data source-managed rules for Mimir and Loki, not for a Prometheus instance.
