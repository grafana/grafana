# Configure feature toggles

You use feature toggles, also known as feature flags, to enable or disable features in Grafana. You can turn on feature toggles to try out new functionality in development or test environments.

This page contains a list of available feature toggles. To learn how to turn on feature toggles, refer to our [Configure Grafana documentation]({{< relref "../_index.md#feature_toggles" >}}). Feature toggles are also available to Grafana Cloud Advanced customers. If you use Grafana Cloud Advanced, you can open a support ticket and specify the feature toggles and stack for which you want them enabled.

For more information about feature release stages, refer to [Release life cycle for Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/docs/release-life-cycle/) and [Manage feature toggles](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/administration/feature-toggles/#manage-feature-toggles).

## General availability feature toggles

Most [generally available](https://grafana.com/docs/release-life-cycle/#general-availability) features are enabled by default. You can disable these feature by setting the feature flag to "false" in the configuration.
