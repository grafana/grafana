# Configure feature toggles

You use feature toggles, also known as feature flags, to enable or disable features in Grafana. You can turn on feature toggles to try out new functionality in development or test environments.

This page contains a list of available feature toggles. To learn how to turn on feature toggles, refer to our [Configure Grafana documentation]({{< relref "../_index.md#feature_toggles" >}}). Feature toggles are also available to Grafana Cloud Advanced customers. If you use Grafana Cloud Advanced, you can open a support ticket and specify the feature toggles and stack for which you want them enabled.

## Feature toggles

Some features are enabled by default. You can disable these feature by setting the feature flag to "false" in the configuration.

## Development feature toggles

The following toggles require explicitly setting Grafana's [app mode]({{< relref "../_index.md#app_mode" >}}) to 'development' before you can enable this feature toggle. These features tend to be experimental.
