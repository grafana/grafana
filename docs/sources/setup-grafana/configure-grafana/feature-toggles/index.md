# Configure feature toggles

You use feature toggles, also known as feature flags, to turn experimental or beta features on and off in Grafana. Although we do not recommend using these features in production, you can turn on feature toggles to try out new functionality in development or test environments.

This page contains a list of available feature toggles. To learn how to turn on feature toggles, refer to our [Configure Grafana documentation]({{< relref "../_index.md/#feature_toggles" >}}). Feature toggles are also available to Grafana Cloud Advanced customers. If you use Grafana Cloud Advanced, you can open a support ticket and specify the feature toggles and stack for which you want them enabled.

## Stable feature toggles

Some stable features are enabled by default. You can disable a stable feature by setting the feature flag to "false" in the configuration.
