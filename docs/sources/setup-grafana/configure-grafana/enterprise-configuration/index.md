# Configure Grafana Enterprise

This page describes Grafana Enterprise-specific configuration options that you can specify in a `.ini` configuration file or using environment variables. Refer to [Configuration]({{< relref "../../configure-grafana" >}}) for more information about available configuration options.

## [enterprise]

### license_path

Local filesystem path to Grafana Enterprise's license file.
Defaults to `<paths.data>/license.jwt`.

### license_text

When set to the text representation (i.e. content of the license file)
of the license, Grafana will evaluate and apply the given license to
the instance.

### auto_refresh_license

When enabled, Grafana will send the license and usage statistics to
the license issuer. If the license has been updated on the issuer's
side to be valid for a different number of users or a new duration,
your Grafana instance will be updated with the new terms
automatically. Defaults to `true`.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
The license only automatically updates once per day. To immediately update the terms for a license, use the Grafana UI to renew your license token.
{{% /admonition %}}

### license_validation_type

When set to `aws`, Grafana will validate its license status with Amazon Web Services (AWS) instead of with Grafana Labs. Only use this setting if you purchased an Enterprise license from AWS Marketplace. Defaults to empty, which means that by default Grafana Enterprise will validate using a license issued by Grafana Labs. For details about licenses issued by AWS, refer to [Activate a Grafana Enterprise license purchased through AWS Marketplace]({{< relref "../../../administration/enterprise-licensing/activate-aws-marketplace-license" >}}).

## [white_labeling]

## [caching]

When query caching is enabled, Grafana can temporarily store the results of data source queries and serve cached responses to similar requests.

### backend

The caching backend to use when storing cached queries. Options: `memory`, `redis`, and `memcached`.

The default is `memory`.

### enabled

Setting 'enabled' to `true` allows users to configure query caching for data sources.

This value is `true` by default.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
This setting enables the caching feature, but it does not turn on query caching for any data source. To turn on query caching for a data source, update the setting on the data source configuration page. For more information, refer to the [query caching docs]({{< relref "../../../administration/data-source-management#enable-and-configure-query-caching" >}}).
{{% /admonition %}}

### ttl

_Time to live_ (TTL) is the time that a query result is stored in the caching system before it is deleted or refreshed. This setting defines the time to live for query caching, when TTL is not configured in data source settings. The default value is `1m` (1 minute).

### max_ttl

The max duration that a query result is stored in the caching system before it is deleted or refreshed. This value will override `ttl` config option or data source setting if the `ttl` value is greater than `max_ttl`. To disable this constraint, set this value to `0s`.

The default is `0s` (disabled).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Disabling this constraint is not recommended in production environments.
{{% /admonition %}}

### max_value_mb

This value limits the size of a single cache value. If a cache value (or query result) exceeds this size, then it is not cached. To disable this limit, set this value to `0`.

The default is `1`.

### connection_timeout

This setting defines the duration to wait for a connection to the caching backend.

The default is `5s`.

### read_timeout

This setting defines the duration to wait for the caching backend to return a cached result. To disable this timeout, set this value to `0s`.

The default is `0s` (disabled).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Disabling this timeout is not recommended in production environments.
{{% /admonition %}}

### write_timeout

This setting defines the number of seconds to wait for the caching backend to store a result. To disable this timeout, set this value to `0s`.

The default is `0s` (disabled).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Disabling this timeout is not recommended in production environments.
{{% /admonition %}}

## [caching.encryption]

### enabled

When 'enabled' is `true`, query values in the cache are encrypted.

The default is `false`.

### encryption_key

A string used to generate a key for encrypting the cache. For the encrypted cache data to persist between Grafana restarts, you must specify this key. If it is empty when encryption is enabled, then the key is automatically generated on startup, and the cache clears upon restarts.

The default is `""`.

## [caching.memory]

### gc_interval

When storing cache data in-memory, this setting defines how often a background process cleans up stale data from the in-memory cache. More frequent "garbage collection" can keep memory usage from climbing but will increase CPU usage.

The default is `1m`.

### max_size_mb

The maximum size of the in-memory cache in megabytes. Once this size is reached, new cache items are rejected. For more flexible control over cache eviction policies and size, use the Redis or Memcached backend.

To disable the maximum, set this value to `0`.

The default is `25`.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Disabling the maximum is not recommended in production environments.
{{% /admonition %}}

## [caching.redis]

### url

The full Redis URL of your Redis server. For example: `redis://username:password@localhost:6379`. To enable TLS, use the `rediss` scheme.

The default is `"redis://localhost:6379"`.

### cluster

A comma-separated list of Redis cluster members, either in `host:port` format or using the full Redis URLs (`redis://username:password@localhost:6379`). For example, `localhost:7000, localhost: 7001, localhost:7002`.
If you use the full Redis URLs, then you can specify the scheme, username, and password only once. For example, `redis://username:password@localhost:0000,localhost:1111,localhost:2222`. You cannot specify a different username and password for each URL.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If you have specify `cluster`, the value for `url` is ignored.
{{% /admonition %}}

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
You can enable TLS for cluster mode using the `rediss` scheme in Grafana Enterprise v8.5 and later versions.
{{% /admonition %}}

### prefix

A string that prefixes all Redis keys. This value must be set if using a shared database in Redis. If `prefix` is empty, then one will not be used.

The default is `"grafana"`.

## [caching.memcached]

### servers

A space-separated list of memcached servers. Example: `memcached-server-1:11211 memcached-server-2:11212 memcached-server-3:11211`. Or if there's only one server: `memcached-server:11211`.

The default is `"localhost:11211"`.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
The following memcached configuration requires the `tlsMemcached` feature toggle.
{{% /admonition %}}

### tls_enabled

### connection_timeout

Timeout for the memcached client to connect to memcached. Defaults to `0`, which uses the memcached client default timeout per connection scheme.

## [recorded_queries]

### enabled

Whether the recorded queries feature is enabled

### min_interval

Sets the minimum interval to enforce between query evaluations. The default value is `10s`. Query evaluation will be
adjusted if they are less than this value. Higher values can help with resource management.

The interval string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, followed by a unit suffix (ms, s, m, h, d), e.g.
30s or 1m.

### max_queries

The maximum number of recorded queries that can exist.

### default_remote_write_datasource_uid

The UID of the datasource where the query data will be written.

If all `default_remote_write_*` properties are set, this information will be populated at startup. If a remote write target has
already been configured, nothing will happen.

### default_remote_write_path
