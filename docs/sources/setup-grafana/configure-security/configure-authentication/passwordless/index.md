# Configure passwordless authentication with magic links

Passwordless authentication lets Grafana users authenticate with a magic link or one-time password (OTP) sent via email.

## Enable passwordless authentication

{{< docs/experimental product="passwordless authentication" featureFlag="passwordlessMagicLinkAuthentication" >}}

To enable passwordless authentication, use the following configuration:

```bash
[auth.passwordless]
enabled = true
```

## Code expiration

By default, the one-time password (OTP) sent to a user's email is valid for 20 minutes. Use the `code_expiration` option to change the duration that the OTP is valid.

```bash
[auth.passwordless]
enabled = true
code_expiration = 20m
```

## Enable SMTP server

The SMTP server must be enabled so that Grafana can send emails.
The following configuration enables the SMTP server.
For more information on configuring the SMTP server, refer to [SMTP](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#smtp).

```bash
[smtp]
enabled = true
```
