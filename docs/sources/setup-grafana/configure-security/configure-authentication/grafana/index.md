# Configure basic authentication

Grafana provides a basic authentication system with password authentication enabled by default. This document details configuration options to manage and enhance basic authentication.

## Disable basic authentication

To disable basic authentication, use the following configuration:

```bash
[auth.basic]
enabled = false
```

## Password policy

By default, Grafanaâ€™s password policy requires a minimum of four characters for basic auth users. For a stronger password policy, enable the `password_policy` configuration option.

With the `password_policy` option enabled, new and updated passwords must meet the following criteria:

- At least 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

```bash
[auth.basic]
password_policy = true
```

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Existing passwords that do not comply with the new password policy will not be affected until the user updates their password.

## Disable login form

To hide the Grafana login form, use the following configuration setting:

```bash
[auth]
disable_login_form = true
```

This can be helpful in setups where authentication is handled entirely through external mechanisms or single sign-on (SSO).
