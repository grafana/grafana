# Configure SAML authentication using the configuration file

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Available in [Grafana Enterprise]({{< relref "../../../../introduction/grafana-enterprise" >}}) and [Grafana Cloud](/docs/grafana-cloud).
{{% /admonition %}}

SAML authentication integration allows your Grafana users to log in by using an external SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP). To enable this, Grafana becomes a Service Provider (SP) in the authentication flow, interacting with the IdP to exchange user information.

You can configure SAML authentication in Grafana through one of the following methods:

- the Grafana configuration file
- the API (refer to [SSO Settings API]({{< relref "../../../../developers/http_api/sso-settings" >}}))
- the user interface (refer to [Configure SAML authentication using the Grafana user interface]({{< relref "../saml-ui" >}}))
- the Terraform provider (refer to [Terraform docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/grafana/grafana/latest/docs/resources/sso_settings))

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
The API and Terraform support are available in Public Preview in Grafana v11.1 behind the `ssoSettingsSAML` feature toggle. You must also enable the `ssoSettingsApi` flag.
{{% /admonition %}}

All methods offer the same configuration options, but you might prefer using the Grafana configuration file or the Terraform provider if you want to keep all of Grafana's authentication settings in one place. Grafana Cloud users do not have access to Grafana configuration file, so they should configure SAML through the other methods.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Configuration in the API takes precedence over the configuration in the Grafana configuration file. SAML settings from the API will override any SAML configuration set in the Grafana configuration file.

## Supported SAML

Grafana supports the following SAML 2.0 bindings:

- From the Service Provider (SP) to the Identity Provider (IdP):

  - `HTTP-POST` binding
  - `HTTP-Redirect` binding

- From the Identity Provider (IdP) to the Service Provider (SP):
  - `HTTP-POST` binding

In terms of security:

- Grafana supports signed and encrypted assertions.
- Grafana does not support signed or encrypted requests.

In terms of initiation, Grafana supports:

- SP-initiated requests
- IdP-initiated requests

By default, SP-initiated requests are enabled. For instructions on how to enable IdP-initiated logins, see [IdP-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO)]({{< relref "#idp-initiated-single-sign-on-sso" >}}).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
It is possible to set up Grafana with SAML authentication using Azure AD. However, if an Azure AD user belongs to more than 150 groups, a Graph API endpoint is shared instead.

Grafana versions 11.1 and below, do not support fetching the groups from the Graph API endpoint. As a result, users with more than 150 groups will not be able to retrieve their groups. Instead, it is recommended that you use OIDC/OAuth workflows,.

As of Grafana 11.2, the SAML integration offers a mechanism to retrieve user groups from the Graph API.

### Edit SAML options in the Grafana config file

1. In the `[auth.saml]` section in the Grafana configuration file, set [`enabled`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#enabled" >}}) to `true`.
1. Configure the [certificate and private key]({{< relref "#certificate-and-private-key" >}}).
1. On the Okta application page where you have been redirected after application created, navigate to the **Sign On** tab and find **Identity Provider metadata** link in the **Settings** section.
1. Set the [`idp_metadata_url`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#idp_metadata_url" >}}) to the URL obtained from the previous step. The URL should look like `https://<your-org-id>.okta.com/app/<application-id>/sso/saml/metadata`.
1. Set the following options to the attribute names configured at the **step 10** of the SAML integration setup. You can find this attributes on the **General** tab of the application page (**ATTRIBUTE STATEMENTS** and **GROUP ATTRIBUTE STATEMENTS** in the **SAML Settings** section).
   - [`assertion_attribute_login`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#assertion_attribute_login" >}})
   - [`assertion_attribute_email`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#assertion_attribute_email" >}})
   - [`assertion_attribute_name`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#assertion_attribute_name" >}})
   - [`assertion_attribute_groups`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#assertion_attribute_groups" >}})
1. Save the configuration file and then restart the Grafana server.

When you are finished, the Grafana configuration might look like this example:

```bash
[server]
root_url = https://grafana.example.com

[auth.saml]
enabled = true
auto_login = false
private_key_path = "/path/to/private_key.pem"
certificate_path = "/path/to/certificate.cert"
idp_metadata_url = "https://my-org.okta.com/app/my-application/sso/saml/metadata"
assertion_attribute_name = DisplayName
assertion_attribute_login = Login
assertion_attribute_email = Email
assertion_attribute_groups = Group
```

## Enable SAML authentication in Grafana

To use the SAML integration, in the `auth.saml` section of in the Grafana custom configuration file, set `enabled` to `true`.

Refer to [Configuration]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana" >}}) for more information about configuring Grafana.

## Additional configuration for HTTP-Post binding

If multiple bindings are supported for SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) by the Identity Provider (IdP), Grafana will use the `HTTP-Redirect` binding by default. If the IdP only supports the `HTTP-Post binding` then updating the `content_security_policy_template` (in case `content_security_policy = true`) and `content_security_policy_report_only_template` (in case `content_security_policy_report_only = true`) might be required to allow Grafana to initiate a POST request to the IdP. These settings are used to define the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) headers that are sent by Grafana.

To allow Grafana to initiate a POST request to the IdP, update the `content_security_policy_template` and `content_security_policy_report_only_template` settings in the Grafana configuration file and add the IdP's domain to the `form-action` directive. By default, the `form-action` directive is set to `self` which only allows POST requests to the same domain as Grafana. To allow POST requests to the IdP's domain, update the `form-action` directive to include the IdP's domain, for example: `form-action 'self' https://idp.example.com`.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
For Grafana Cloud instances, please contact Grafana Support to update the `content_security_policy_template` and `content_security_policy_report_only_template` settings of your Grafana instance. Please provide the metadata URL/file of your IdP.

## Certificate and private key

The SAML SSO standard uses asymmetric encryption to exchange information between the SP (Grafana) and the IdP. To perform such encryption, you need a public part and a private part. In this case, the X.509 certificate provides the public part, while the private key provides the private part. The private key needs to be issued in a [PKCS#8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_8) format.

Grafana supports two ways of specifying both the `certificate` and `private_key`.

- Without a suffix (`certificate` or `private_key`), the configuration assumes you've supplied the base64-encoded file contents.
- With the `_path` suffix (`certificate_path` or `private_key_path`), then Grafana treats the value entered as a file path and attempts to read the file from the file system.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
You can only use one form of each configuration option. Using multiple forms, such as both `certificate` and `certificate_path`, results in an error.

### Generate private key for SAML authentication:

An example of how to generate a self-signed certificate and private key that's valid for one year:

```sh
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodesâ€‹
```

The generated `key.pem` and `cert.pem` files are then used for certificate and private_key.

The key you provide should look like:

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

## Set up SAML with Azure AD

Grafana supports user authentication through Azure AD, which is useful when you want users to access Grafana using single sign-on. This topic shows you how to configure SAML authentication in Grafana with [Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/).

**Before you begin:**

- Ensure you have permission to administer SAML authentication. For more information about roles and permissions in Grafana.
  - [Roles and permissions]({{< relref "../../../../administration/roles-and-permissions" >}}).
- Learn the limitations of Azure AD SAML integration.
  - [Azure AD SAML limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/id-token-claims-reference#groups-overage-claim)
- Configure SAML integration with Azure AD, create an app integration inside the Azure AD organization first.
  - [Add app integration in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/add-application-portal-configure)
- If you have users that belong to more than 150 groups, you need to configure a registered application to provide an Azure Graph API to retrieve the groups.
  - [Setup Azure AD Graph API applications]({{< relref "#set-up-saml-with-azure-ad" >}})

### Generate self-signed certificates

Azure AD requires a certificate to sign the SAML requests. You can generate a self-signed certificate using the following command:

```sh
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

This will generate a `key.pem` and `cert.pem` file that you can use for the `private_key_path` and `certificate_path` configuration options.

### Add Microsoft Entra SAML Toolkit from the gallery

> Taken from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/saml-toolkit-tutorial#add-microsoft-entra-saml-toolkit-from-the-gallery

## Configure SAML authentication in Grafana

The table below describes all SAML configuration options. Continue reading below for details on specific options. Like any other Grafana configuration, you can apply these options as [environment variables]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana#override-configuration-with-environment-variables" >}}).

### Signature algorithm

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Available in Grafana version 7.3 and later.
{{% /admonition %}}

The SAML standard recommends using a digital signature for some types of messages, like authentication or logout requests. If the `signature_algorithm` option is configured, Grafana will put a digital signature into SAML requests. Supported signature types are `rsa-sha1`, `rsa-sha256`, `rsa-sha512`. This option should match your IdP configuration, otherwise, signature validation will fail. Grafana uses key and certificate configured with `private_key` and `certificate` options for signing SAML requests.

### Specify user's Name ID

The `name_id_format` configuration field specifies the format of the NameID element in the SAML assertion.

By default, this is set to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient` and does not need to be specified in the configuration file.

The following list includes valid configuration field values:

- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`

### IdP metadata

You also need to define the public part of the IdP for message verification. The SAML IdP metadata XML defines where and how Grafana exchanges user information.

Grafana supports three ways of specifying the IdP metadata.

- Without a suffix `idp_metadata`, Grafana assumes base64-encoded XML file contents.
- With the `_path` suffix, Grafana assumes a file path and attempts to read the file from the file system.
- With the `_url` suffix, Grafana assumes a URL and attempts to load the metadata from the given location.

### Maximum issue delay

Prevents SAML response replay attacks and internal clock skews between the SP (Grafana) and the IdP. You can set a maximum amount of time between the IdP issuing a response and the SP (Grafana) processing it.

The configuration options is specified as a duration, such as `max_issue_delay = 90s` or `max_issue_delay = 1h`.

### Metadata valid duration

SP metadata is likely to expire at some point, perhaps due to a certificate rotation or change of location binding. Grafana allows you to specify for how long the metadata should be valid. Leveraging the `validUntil` field, you can tell consumers until when your metadata is going to be valid. The duration is computed by adding the duration to the current time.

The configuration option is specified as a duration, such as `metadata_valid_duration = 48h`.

### Identity provider (IdP) registration

For the SAML integration to work correctly, you need to make the IdP aware of the SP.

The integration provides two key endpoints as part of Grafana:

- The `/saml/metadata` endpoint, which contains the SP metadata. You can either download and upload it manually, or you make the IdP request it directly from the endpoint. Some providers name it Identifier or Entity ID.
- The `/saml/acs` endpoint, which is intended to receive the ACS (Assertion Customer Service) callback. Some providers name it SSO URL or Reply URL.

### IdP-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO)

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Available in Grafana version 7.3 and later.
{{% /admonition %}}

By default, Grafana allows only service provider (SP) initiated logins (when the user logs in with SAML via Grafanaâ€™s login page). If you want users to log in into Grafana directly from your identity provider (IdP), set the `allow_idp_initiated` configuration option to `true` and configure `relay_state` with the same value specified in the IdP configuration.

IdP-initiated SSO has some security risks, so make sure you understand the risks before enabling this feature. When using IdP-initiated SSO, Grafana receives unsolicited SAML requests and can't verify that login flow was started by the user. This makes it hard to detect whether SAML message has been stolen or replaced. Because of this, IdP-initiated SSO is vulnerable to login cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and manÂ in the middle (MITM) attacks. We do not recommend using IdP-initiated SSO and keeping it disabled whenever possible.

### Single logout

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Available in Grafana version 7.3 and later.
{{% /admonition %}}

SAML's single logout feature allows users to log out from all applications associated with the current IdP session established via SAML SSO. If the `single_logout` option is set to `true` and a user logs out, Grafana requests IdP to end the user session which in turn triggers logout from all other applications the user is logged into using the same IdP session (applications should support single logout). Conversely, if another application connected to the same IdP logs out using single logout, Grafana receives a logout request from IdP and ends the user session.

`HTTP-Redirect` and `HTTP-POST` bindings are supported for single logout.
When using `HTTP-Redirect` bindings the query should include a request signature.

### Assertion mapping

During the SAML SSO authentication flow, Grafana receives the ACS callback. The callback contains all the relevant information of the user under authentication embedded in the SAML response. Grafana parses the response to create (or update) the user within its internal database.

For Grafana to map the user information, it looks at the individual attributes within the assertion. You can think of these attributes as Key/Value pairs (although, they contain more information than that).

Grafana provides configuration options that let you modify which keys to look at for these values. The data we need to create the user in Grafana is Name, Login handle, and email.

#### The `assertion_attribute_name` option

`assertion_attribute_name` is a special assertion mapping that can either be a simple key, indicating a mapping to a single assertion attribute on the SAML response, or a complex template with variables using the `$__saml{<attribute>}` syntax. If this property is misconfigured, Grafana will log an error message on startup and disallow SAML sign-ins. Grafana will also log errors after a login attempt if a variable in the template is missing from the SAML response.

**Examples**

```ini
#plain string mapping
assertion_attribute_name = displayName
```

```ini
#template mapping
assertion_attribute_name = $__saml{firstName} $__saml{lastName}
```

### Allow new user signups

By default, new Grafana users using SAML authentication will have an account created for them automatically. To decouple authentication and account creation and ensure only users with existing accounts can log in with SAML, set the `allow_sign_up` option to false.

### Configure automatic login

Set `auto_login` option to true to attempt login automatically, skipping the login screen.
This setting is ignored if multiple auth providers are configured to use auto login.

```
auto_login = true
```

### Configure team sync

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Team sync support for SAML is available in Grafana version 7.0 and later.
{{% /admonition %}}

To use SAML Team sync, set [`assertion_attribute_groups`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#assertion_attribute_groups" >}}) to the attribute name where you store user groups. Then Grafana will use attribute values extracted from SAML assertion to add user into the groups with the same name configured on the External group sync tab.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Teamsync allows you sync users from SAML to Grafana teams. It does not automatically create teams in Grafana. You need to create teams in Grafana before you can use this feature.
{{% /admonition %}}

Given the following partial SAML assertion:

```xml
<saml2:Attribute
    Name="groups"
    NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:unspecified">
    <saml2:AttributeValue
        xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type="xs:string">admins_group
    </saml2:AttributeValue>
    <saml2:AttributeValue
        xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:type="xs:string">division_1
    </saml2:AttributeValue>
</saml2:Attribute>
```

The configuration would look like this:

```ini
[auth.saml]
# ...
assertion_attribute_groups = groups
```

The following `External Group ID`s would be valid for input in the desired team's _External group sync_ tab:

- `admins_group`
- `division_1`

### Configure role sync

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Available in Grafana version 7.0 and later.
{{% /admonition %}}

Role sync allows you to map user roles from an identity provider to Grafana. To enable role sync, configure role attribute and possible values for the Editor, Admin, and Grafana Admin roles. For more information about user roles, refer to [Roles and permissions]({{< relref "../../../../administration/roles-and-permissions" >}}).

1. In the configuration file, set [`assertion_attribute_role`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#assertion_attribute_role" >}}) option to the attribute name where the role information will be extracted from.
1. Set the [`role_values_none`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#role_values_none" >}}) option to the values mapped to the `None` role.
1. Set the [`role_values_viewer`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#role_values_viewer" >}}) option to the values mapped to the `Viewer` role.
1. Set the [`role_values_editor`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#role_values_editor" >}}) option to the values mapped to the `Editor` role.
1. Set the [`role_values_admin`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#role_values_admin" >}}) option to the values mapped to the organization `Admin` role.
1. Set the [`role_values_grafana_admin`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#role_values_grafana_admin" >}}) option to the values mapped to the `Grafana Admin` role.

If a user role doesn't match any of configured values, then the role specified by the `auto_assign_org_role` config option will be assigned. If the `auto_assign_org_role` field is not set then the user role will default to `Viewer`.

For more information about roles and permissions in Grafana, refer to [Roles and permissions]({{< relref "../../../../administration/roles-and-permissions" >}}).

Example configuration:

```ini
[auth.saml]
assertion_attribute_role = role
role_values_none = none
role_values_viewer = external
role_values_editor = editor, developer
role_values_admin = admin, operator
role_values_grafana_admin = superadmin
```

**Important**: When role sync is configured, any changes of user roles and organization membership made manually in Grafana will be overwritten on next user login. Assign user organizations and roles in the IdP instead.

Available in Grafana version 9.2 and later.
{{% /admonition %}}

If you don't want user organizations and roles to be synchronized with the IdP, you can use the `skip_org_role_sync` configuration option.

Example configuration:

```ini
[auth.saml]
skip_org_role_sync = true
```

### Configure organization mapping

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Available in Grafana version 7.0 and later.
{{% /admonition %}}

Organization mapping allows you to assign users to particular organization in Grafana depending on attribute value obtained from identity provider.

1. In configuration file, set [`assertion_attribute_org`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#assertion_attribute_org" >}}) to the attribute name you store organization info in. This attribute can be an array if you want a user to be in multiple organizations.
1. Set [`org_mapping`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#org_mapping" >}}) option to the comma-separated list of `Organization:OrgId` pairs to map organization from IdP to Grafana organization specified by id. If you want users to have different roles in multiple organizations, you can set this option to a comma-separated list of `Organization:OrgId:Role` mappings.

For example, use following configuration to assign users from `Engineering` organization to the Grafana organization with id `2` as Editor and users from `Sales` - to the org with id `3` as Admin, based on `Org` assertion attribute value:

```bash
[auth.saml]
assertion_attribute_org = Org
org_mapping = Engineering:2:Editor, Sales:3:Admin
```

You can specify multiple organizations both for the IdP and Grafana:

- `org_mapping = Engineering:2, Sales:2` to map users from `Engineering` and `Sales` to `2` in Grafana.
- `org_mapping = Engineering:2, Engineering:3` to assign `Engineering` to both `2` and `3` in Grafana.

You can use `*` as the SAML Organization if you want all your users to be in some Grafana organizations with a default role:

- `org_mapping = *:2:Editor` to map all users to `2` in Grafana as Editors.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Available in Grafana version 9.2 and later.
{{% /admonition %}}

You can use `*` as the Grafana organization in the mapping if you want all users from a given SAML Organization to be added to all existing Grafana organizations.

- `org_mapping = Engineering:*` to map users from `Engineering` to all existing Grafana organizations.
- `org_mapping = Administration:*:Admin` to map users from `Administration` to all existing Grafana organizations as Admins.

### Configure allowed organizations

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Available in Grafana version 7.0 and later.
{{% /admonition %}}

With the [`allowed_organizations`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana/enterprise-configuration#allowed_organizations" >}}) option you can specify a list of organizations where the user must be a member of at least one of them to be able to log in to Grafana.

To put values containing spaces in the list, use the following JSON syntax:

```ini
allowed_organizations = ["org 1", "second org"]
```

### Example SAML configuration

```bash
[auth.saml]
enabled = true
auto_login = false
certificate_path = "/path/to/certificate.cert"
private_key_path = "/path/to/private_key.pem"
idp_metadata_path = "/my/metadata.xml"
max_issue_delay = 90s
metadata_valid_duration = 48h
assertion_attribute_name = displayName
assertion_attribute_login = mail
assertion_attribute_email = mail

assertion_attribute_groups = Group
assertion_attribute_role = Role
assertion_attribute_org = Org
role_values_viewer = external
role_values_editor = editor, developer
role_values_admin = admin, operator
role_values_grafana_admin = superadmin
org_mapping = Engineering:2:Editor, Engineering:3:Viewer, Sales:3:Editor, *:1:Editor
allowed_organizations = Engineering, Sales
```

## Troubleshoot SAML authentication in Grafana

To troubleshoot and get more log information, enable SAML debug logging in the configuration file. Refer to [Configuration]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana#filters" >}}) for more information.

```bash
[log]
filters = saml.auth:debug
```

## Troubleshooting

Following are common issues found in configuring SAML authentication in Grafana and how to resolve them.

### Infinite redirect loop / User gets redirected to the login page after successful login on the IdP side

If you experience an infinite redirect loop when `auto_login = true` or redirected to the login page after successful login, it is likely that the `grafana_session` cookie's SameSite setting is set to `Strict`. This setting prevents the `grafana_session` cookie from being sent to Grafana during cross-site requests. To resolve this issue, set the `security.cookie_samesite` option to `Lax` in the Grafana configuration file.

### SAML authentication fails with error:

- `asn1: structure error: tags don't match`

We only support one private key format: PKCS#8.

The keys may be in a different format (PKCS#1 or PKCS#12); in that case, it may be necessary to convert the private key format.

The following command creates a pkcs8 key file.

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

#### **Convert** the private key format to base64

The following command converts keys to base64 format.

Base64-encode the cert.pem and key.pem files:
(-w0 switch is not needed on Mac, only for Linux)

```sh
$ base64 -w0 key.pem > key.pem.base64
$ base64 -w0 cert.pem > cert.pem.base64
```

The base64-encoded values (`key.pem.base64, cert.pem.base64` files) are then used for certificate and private_key.

The keys you provide should look like:

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### SAML login attempts fail with request response "origin not allowed"

When the user logs in using SAML and gets presented with "origin not allowed", the user might be issuing the login from an IdP (identity provider) service or the user is behind a reverse proxy. This potentially happens as Grafana's CSRF checks deem the requests to be invalid. For more information [CSRF](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf).

To solve this issue, you can configure either the [`csrf_trusted_origins`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana#csrf_trusted_origins" >}}) or [`csrf_additional_headers`]({{< relref "../../../configure-grafana#csrf_additional_headers" >}}) option in the SAML configuration.

Example of a configuration file:

```bash
# config.ini
...
[security]
csrf_trusted_origins = https://grafana.example.com
csrf_additional_headers = X-Forwarded-Host
...
```

### SAML login attempts fail with request response "login session has expired"

Accessing the Grafana login page from a URL that is not the root URL of the
Grafana server can cause the instance to return the following error: "login session has expired".

If you are accessing grafana through a proxy server, ensure that cookies are correctly
rewritten to the root URL of Grafana.
Cookies must be set on the same url as the `root_url` of Grafana. This is normally the reverse proxy's domain/address.

Review the cookie settings in your proxy server configuration to ensure that cookies are
not being discarded

Review the following settings in your grafana config:

```ini
[security]
cookie_samesite = none
```

This setting should be set to none to allow grafana session cookies to work correctly with redirects.

```ini
[security]
cookie_secure = true
```

Ensure cookie_secure is set to true to ensure that cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
