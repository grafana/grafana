# Configure Grafana secret scanning and notifications

With Grafana, you can use the GitHub Secret Scanning service to determine if your [service account tokens]({{< relref "../../administration/service-accounts" >}}) have been leaked on GitHub.

When GitHub Secret Scanning detects a Grafana secret, its hash is stored in Grafana Labs' secret scanning service.

Grafana instances, whether on-premises or on the cloud, can use this service to verify if a token generated by the instance has been made public. This verification is done by comparing the token's hash with the exposed token's hash.

If the service detects a leaked token, it immediately revokes it, making it useless, and logs the event.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If the `revoke` option is disabled, the service only sends a notification to the configured webhook URL and logs the event. The token is not automatically revoked.
{{% /admonition %}}

You can also configure the service to send an outgoing webhook notification to a webhook URL.

The notification includes a JSON payload that contains the following data:

```json
{
  "alert_uid": "c9ce50a1-d66b-45e4-9b5d-175766cfc026",
  "link_to_upstream_details": <URL to token leak>,
  "message": "Token of type grafana_service_account_token with name
sa-the-toucans has been publicly exposed in <URL to token leak>.
Grafana has revoked this token",
  "state": "alerting",
  "title": "SecretScan Alert: Grafana Token leaked"
}
```

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Secret scanning is disabled by default. Outgoing connections are made once you enable it.
{{% /admonition %}}

## Before you begin

- Ensure all your API keys have been migrated to service accounts.
  For more information about service account migration, refer to [Migrate API keys to Grafana service accounts](/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/administration/service-accounts/migrate-api-keys/).

## Configure secret scanning

1. Open the Grafana configuration file.

1. In the `[secretscan]` section, update the following parameters:

```ini
[secretscan]
# Enable secretscan feature
enabled = true

# Whether to revoke the token if a leak is detected or just send a notification
revoke = true
```

Save the configuration file and restart Grafana.

## Configure outgoing webhook notifications

1. Create an oncall integration of the type **Webhook** and set up alerts.
   To learn how to create a Grafana OnCall integration, refer to [Inbound Webhook integrations for Grafana OnCall](/docs/oncall/latest/integrations/webhook/).

1. Copy the webhook URL of the new integration.

1. Open the Grafana configuration file.

1. In the `[secretscan]` section, update the following parameters,
   replacing the URL with the webhook URL you copied in step 2.

```ini
[secretscan]
# URL to send a webhook payload in oncall format
oncall_url = https://example.url/integrations/v1/webhook/3a359nib9eweAd9lAAAETVdOx/
```

Save the configuration file and restart Grafana.
