# Sign in to Grafana

To sign in to Grafana for the first time:

1. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/. The default HTTP port that Grafana listens to is `3000` unless you have configured a different port.
1. On the signin page, enter `admin` for username and password.
1. Click **Sign in**. If successful, you will see a prompt to change the password.
1. Click **OK** on the prompt and change your password.

> **Note:** We strongly recommend that you change the default administrator password.
