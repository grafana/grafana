# Import data source-managed rules to Grafana-managed rules

You can convert existing alert rules from data sources such as Mimir, Loki, and Prometheus into Grafana-managed alert rules. This enables you to operate and manage these rules using Grafana Alerting.

This guide explains two methods for importing data source-managed rules:

- Using the [Grafana Alerting user interface](#import-rules-with-grafana-alerting) to import rules from connected data sources or Prometheus rule YAML files.

- Using [command-line tools](#import-rules-with-command-line-tools) like `mimirtool` and `cortextool` to import rules from YAML files.

Importing rules is a safe operation: the original data source–managed rules remain intact in their original location. During import, the rules are converted into Grafana-managed rules while preserving their configuration and behavior.

Choose the method that best fits your workflow. As a best practice, test and validate your import process before migrating all alert rules.

## How it works

When you use any of the import methods, data source–managed rules are copied to another folder as Grafana-managed rules.

The original data source–managed rules remain intact in their original location.

The copied rules are converted to Grafana-managed rules, preserving their behavior by using equivalent Grafana-managed features. The following settings are applied during the conversion:

- **Unique UIDs**

  The newly created rules are assigned unique UIDs.
  If you don’t want a UID to be auto-generated, you can specify one using the `__grafana_alert_rule_uid__` label.

- **Query offset**

  A query offset is applied to each rule. For example, an offset of `1m` adjusts the query's time range to `To: now-1m`.

  The rule query offset is taken from the `query_offset` value in the rule group configuration. If empty, it defaults to the [`rule_query_offset` configuration setting](ref:configure-grafana-rule_query_offset), which is `1m` by default.

- **Missing series evaluations to resolve**

  The [Missing series evaluations to resolve](ref:missing_series_evaluations_to_resolve) setting is set to `1` to replicate Prometheus’s alert eviction behavior.

- **Rule group labels**

  Labels defined at the rule group level are added as labels to each imported rule within the group.

- **Sequential evaluation**

  Imported rules are evaluated sequentially within each rule group, mirroring Prometheus behavior. This differs from native Grafana-managed alert rules, where the evaluation order is not enforced. For more details, refer to [evaluation strategies](ref:evaluation-strategies).

- **Feature compatibility**

  The rule group `limit` option and the `query` function within alert rule templates are not currently supported in Grafana-managed rules. If the `limit` option is present, the import fails. However, rules with `query` in templates are imported.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Rules with the label `__grafana_origin` are not included in rule imports. These rules are typically created by apps such as **Kubernetes Monitoring**, **Synthetic Monitoring**, and other **Grafana plugins**.

## Import rules with Grafana Alerting

You can use the Grafana Alerting user interface to import rules from the following sources:

- Connected Mimir and Loki data sources with the ruler API enabled
- Prometheus YAML rule files

Imported rules using this method are editable in the user interface. Like regular Grafana-managed rules, you can later export them for provisioning.

#### Before you begin

To use Grafana Alerting to migrate rules, you need the following [RBAC permissions](/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/):

- **Alerting**: `Rules Writer`, `Set provisioning status`.
- **Datasources**: `Reader`.
- **Folders**: `Creator`.

  The Folders permission is optional and only necessary if you want to create new folders for your target namespace. If your account doesn't have permissions to view a namespace, the tool creates a new one.

To convert data source-managed alert rules to Grafana managed alerts:

1. Go to **Alerting > Alert rules**.

2. Navigate to the Data source-managed alert rules section and click **Import to Grafana-managed rules**.

3. Choose the **Import source** from which you want to import rules:

   - Select **Existing data source-managed rules** to import rules from connected Mimir or Loki data sources with the ruler API enabled.
   - Select **Prometheus YAML file** to import rules by uploading a Prometheus YAML rule file.

4. In the **Data source** dropdown, select the data source that the imported alert rules will query.

5. (Optional) In Additional settings, select a target folder or designate a new folder to import the rules into.

   If you import the rules into an existing folder, don't choose a folder with existing alert rules, as they could get overwritten.

6. (Optional) Select a Namespace and/or Group to determine which rules are imported.

7. (Optional) Turn on **Pause imported alerting rules**.

   Pausing stops alert rule evaluation and doesn’t create any alert instances for the newly created Grafana-managed alert rules.

8. (Optional) Turn on **Pause imported recording rules**.

   Pausing stops alert rule evaluation behavior for the newly created Grafana-managed alert rules.

9. (Optional) In the **Target data source** of the **Recording rules** section, you can select the data source that the imported recording rules will query. By default, it is the data source selected in the **Data source** dropdown.

10. Click **Import**.

    A preview shows the rules that will be imported. If your target folder contains folders with the same name of the imported folders, a warning displays to inform you. You can explore the warning to see a list of folders that might be overwritten.

    Click **Yes, import** to import the rules.

## Import rules with command-line tools

You can also use command-line tools to import data source-managed rules as Grafana-managed rules: use `mimirtool` for Mimir and Prometheus rules, and `cortextool` for Loki rules.

Both tools provide `rules` commands to import rules groups. For example:

- `rules load` can import rule groups from files.
- `rules sync` can read rule files and applies only the differences compared to existing Grafana-managed rules. This is useful for automation workflows and pipelines.

By default, rules imported using the API or command-line tools are **Provisioned** and not editable in the user interface. To make them editable, enable the [X-Disable-Provenance](#x-disable-provenance) header.

#### Before you begin

You need to have installed [`mimirtool`](/docs/mimir/latest/manage/tools/mimirtool/) or [`cortextool`](https://github.com/grafana/cortex-tools) (version `0.11.3` or later).

You need a service account with the following [RBAC permissions](/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/):

- **Alerting**: `Rules Reader`, `Rules Writer`, `Set provisioning status`.
- **Datasources**: `Reader`.
- **Folders**: `Creator`, `Reader`, `Writer`.

You need to a service account token with your service account. For more details, refer to [service accounts and service account tokens](/docs/grafana/latest/administration/service-accounts/).

### mimirtool

To convert and import them into a Grafana instance, you can use the `mimirtool rules load` command:

```bash
MIMIR_ADDRESS=<GRAFANA_BASE_URL>/api/convert/ \
MIMIR_AUTH_TOKEN=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN> \
MIMIR_TENANT_ID=1 \
mimirtool rules load rule_file.yaml \
  --extra-headers "X-Grafana-Alerting-Datasource-UID=<DATASOURCE_UID_QUERY_TARGET>"
```

This command imports Prometheus alert rules defined in `rule_file.yaml` as Grafana-managed alert rules. It's important to know that:

1. When using the `<GRAFANA_BASE_URL>/api/convert/` endpoint, `mimirtool` interacts with Grafana—not with a Mimir instance. In this case, `MIMIR_TENANT_ID` must always be set to `1`.
1. The [`X-Grafana-Alerting-Datasource-UID` header](#x-grafana-alerting-datasource-uid) configures the data source that the imported alert rules will query. Use multiple `--extra-headers` flags to include other [optional headers](#optional-headers).

Similarly, the `rules sync` command can import and update Grafana-managed alert rules.

```bash
MIMIR_ADDRESS=<GRAFANA_BASE_URL>/api/convert/ \
MIMIR_AUTH_TOKEN=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN> \
MIMIR_TENANT_ID=1 \
mimirtool rules sync rule_file.yaml \
  --extra-headers "X-Grafana-Alerting-Datasource-UID=<DATASOURCE_UID_QUERY_TARGET>" \
  --concurrency 1
```

The `--concurrency` flag must be set to `1`, as the default value of `8` may cause API errors.

This `sync` command reads rules from the file, compares them with the existing Grafana-managed rules in the instance, and applies only the differences—creating, updating, or deleting rules as needed.

```output
## Sync Summary: 0 Groups Created, 1 Groups Updated, 0 Groups Deleted
```

For more information other Mimirtool commands and options, see the [Mimirtool documentation](/docs/mimir/latest/manage/tools/mimirtool/#rules) and the [Mimir HTTP Rule API documentation](/docs/mimir/latest/references/http-api/#ruler-rules:~:text=config/v1/rules-,Get%20rule%20groups%20by%20namespace,DELETE%20%3Cprometheus%2Dhttp%2Dprefix%3E/config/v1/rules/%7Bnamespace%7D,-Delete%20tenant%20configuration).

### cortextool

For Loki alert rules, use [`cortextool`](https://github.com/grafana/cortex-tools) (version `0.11.3` or later) with the `--backend=loki` flag. For example:

```bash
CORTEX_ADDRESS=<GRAFANA_BASE_URL>/api/convert/ \
CORTEX_AUTH_TOKEN=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN> \
CORTEX_TENANT_ID=1 \
cortextool rules load loki_rules.yaml \
  --extra-headers "X-Grafana-Alerting-Datasource-UID=<LOKI_DATASOURCE_UID_QUERY_TARGET>" \
  --backend=loki
```

### Optional Headers

Additional configuration headers for more granular import control include the following:

#### `X-Disable-Provenance`

When this header is set to `true`:

- The imported rules are not marked as provisioned.
- They can then be edited in the Grafana UI.
- They are excluded from the `GET` and `DELETE` operations on the [`/api/convert` endpoints](#compatible-endpoints).

Do not enable this header when using the `rules sync` command, as it relies on the `GET` and `DELETE` operations to detect and update existing rules.

#### `X-Grafana-Alerting-Alert-Rules-Paused`

Set to `true` to import alert rules in paused state.

#### `X-Grafana-Alerting-Recording-Rules-Paused`

Set to `true` to import recording rules in paused state.

#### `X-Grafana-Alerting-Datasource-UID`

The UID of the data source to use for alert rule queries.

#### `X-Grafana-Alerting-Target-Datasource-UID`

The UID of the target data source for recording rules. If not specified, the value from `X-Grafana-Alerting-Datasource-UID` is used.

#### `X-Grafana-Alerting-Folder-UID`

Enter the UID of the target destination folder for imported rules.

#### `X-Grafana-Alerting-Notification-Settings`

JSON-encoded [`AlertRuleNotificationSettings` object](#alertrulenotificationsettings-object) that allows setting the contact point for the alert rules.

{{< collapse title="AlertRuleNotificationSettings object" >}}

##### AlertRuleNotificationSettings object

When you set `X-Grafana-Alerting-Notification-Settings`, the header value must be a JSON-encoded object with the following keys:

### Compatible endpoints

The API endpoints listed in this section are supported in Grafana and are used by mimirtool and cortextool, as shown earlier.

The `POST` endpoints can be used to import data source–managed alert rules.

| Endpoint | Method                                              | Summary                                                                                                                                               |
