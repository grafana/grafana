# Configure alert rules

[Alert rules](ref:alert-rules) are the central component of your alerting system.

An alert rule consists of one or more queries and expressions that select the data you want to measure. It contains a condition to trigger the alert, an evaluation period that determines how often the rule is evaluated, and additional options to manage alert events and their notifications.

Grafana supports two types of alert rules:

1. Grafana-managed alert rules: These can query multiple data sources.

1. Data source-managed alert rules: These can only query Prometheus-based data sources and support horizontal scaling.

We recommend using Grafana-managed alert rules whenever possible, and opting for data source-managed alert rules when horizontal scaling is required. Refer to the [comparison table of alert rule types](ref:alert-types-comparison-table) for a more detailed overview.

Both types of alert rules can be configured in Grafana using the **+ New alert rule** flow. For step-by-step instructions, refer to:

- [Configure Grafana-managed alert rules](ref:configure-grafana-alerts)
- [Configure data source-managed alert rules](ref:configure-ds-alerts)
- [Create and link alert rules to panels](ref:templating-labels-annotations)

Alert rules can also query metrics generated by recording rules. To learn more, refer to:

- [Create recording rules](ref:recording-rules)
