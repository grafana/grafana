# Create and link alert rules to panels

Grafana allows you to link an alert rule to a dashboard panel. This can help you:

- Inform alert responders about where to investigate and which data to examine.
- Visualize the alert state directly from dashboards.

An alert rule is linked to a panel by setting the [`dashboardUId` and `panelId` annotations](ref:annotations). Both annotations must be set together.

## Link alert rules to panels

When configuring the alert rule, you can set the dashboard and panel annotations as shown in this [video](https://youtu.be/ClLp-iSoaSY?si=qKWnvSVaQuvYcuw9&t=170).

1. Configure the alert rule.
1. In the **Configure notification message** section, click **Link dashboard and panel**.
1. Select an existing dashboard, then choose a panel from the selected dashboard.
1. Complete the alert rule configuration and click **Save rule** to initiate the alert rule.

You can then [view the alert state on the panel](ref:view-alert-state-on-panels).

## Create alert rules from panels

To streamline alert creation, you can create an alert rule directly from a panel.

1. Navigate to a dashboard in the **Dashboards** section.
1. Hover over the top-right corner of a panel and click the panel menu icon.
1. From the dropdown menu, select **More...** > **New alert rule**.
1. This opens the **Edit rule** form and pre-fills some values:
   - Sets the `dashboardUId` and `panelId` annotations to the corresponding dashboard and panel.
   - Sets the alert rule query using the panel query.
1. Complete the alert rule configuration and click **Save rule** to initiate the alert rule.

You can then [view the alert state on the panel](ref:view-alert-state-on-panels).

Changes to panel and alert rule queries aren't synchronized. If you change a query, you have to update it in both the panel and the alert rule.

## Access linked alert rules from panels

This option is available only in [time series panels](ref:time-series-visualizations). To access alert rules associated to a time series panel, complete the following steps.

1. Hover over the top-right corner of the panel and click the panel menu icon.
1. Click **Edit**.
1. Click the **Alert** tab to view existing alert rules or create a new one.
