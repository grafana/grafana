# View and filter alert rules

The Alerting page lists all existing alert rules. By default, rules are grouped by types of data sources. The Grafana section lists all Grafana managed rules. Alert rules for Prometheus compatible data sources are also listed here. You can view alert rules for Prometheus compatible data sources but you cannot edit them.

The Mimir/Cortex/Loki rules section lists all rules for Mimir, Cortex, or Loki data sources. Cloud alert rules are also listed in this section.

When managing large volumes of alerts, you can use extended alert rule search capabilities to filter on folders, evaluation groups, and rules. Additionally, you can filter alert rules by their properties like labels, state, type, and health.

## View alert rules

To view alerting details:

1. In the Grafana menu, click the **Alerting** (bell) icon to open the Alerting page. By default, the List view displays.
1. In **View as**, toggle between Grouped or State views by clicking the relevant option. See [Grouped view](#grouped-view) and [State view](#state-view) for more information.
1. Expand the rule row to view the rule labels, annotations, data sources the rule queries, and a list of alert instances resulting from this rule.

From the Alert list page, you can also make copies of alert rules to help you reuse existing alert rules.

## Export alert rules

Click **Export** to create and tune an alert rule in the UI, then export to YAML or JSON, and use in the provisioning API or files. You can also export an entire rule group to review or use.

**Note:** This is supported in both the UI and provisioning API.

## View query definitions for provisioned alerts

View read-only query definitions for provisioned alerts. Check quickly if your alert rule queries are correct, without diving into your "as-code" repository for rule definitions.

### Grouped view

Grouped view shows Grafana alert rules grouped by folder and Loki or Prometheus alert rules grouped by `namespace` + `group`. This is the default rule list view, intended for managing rules. You can expand each group to view a list of rules in this group. Expand a rule further to view its details. You can also expand action buttons and alerts resulting from the rule to view their details.

### State view

State view shows alert rules grouped by state. Use this view to get an overview of which rules are in what state. Each rule can be expanded to view its details. Action buttons and any alerts generated by this rule, and each alert can be further expanded to view its details.

## Filter alert rules

To filter alert rules:

- From **Select data sources**, select a data source. You can see alert rules that query the selected data source.
- In the **Search by label**, enter search criteria using label selectors. For example, `environment=production,region=~US|EU,severity!=warning`.
- From **Filter alerts by state**, select an alerting state you want to see. You can see alerting rules that match the state. Rules matching other states are hidden.
