# Monitor status

Use Grafana Alerting to track and generate alerts and send notifications, providing an efficient way for engineers to monitor, respond, and triage issues within their services.

Alerts and alert notifications provide a lot of value as key indicators to issues during the triage process, providing engineers with the information they need to understand what is going on in their system or service.
