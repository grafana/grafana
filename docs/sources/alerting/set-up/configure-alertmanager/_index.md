# Configure Alertmanagers

Grafana Alerting is based on the architecture of the Prometheus alerting system. Grafana sends firing and resolved alerts to an Alertmanager, which is responsible for [handling notifications](ref:notifications). This architecture decouples alert rule evaluation from notification handling, improving scalability.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/alerting/alerting-alertmanager-architecture.png" max-width="750px" alt="A diagram with the alert generator and alert manager architecture" >}}

Grafana can enable one or more Alertmanagers to receive Grafana-managed alerts for notification handling. Itâ€™s important to note that each Alertmanager manages its own independent alerting resources, such as:

- Contact points and notification templates
- Notification policies and mute timings
- Silences
- Active notifications

Use the `Choose Alertmanager` dropdown on these pages to switch between Alertmanagers and view or manage their resources.

## Types of Alertmanagers in Grafana

Grafana can be configured to handle alert notifications using various Alertmanagers.

- **Grafana Alertmanager**: Grafana includes a built-in Alertmanager that extends the [Prometheus Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/). This is the default Alertmanager and is referred to as "Grafana" in the user interface. It can only handle Grafana-managed alerts.

- **Cloud Alertmanager**: Each Grafana Cloud instance comes preconfigured with an additional Alertmanager (`grafanacloud-STACK_NAME-ngalertmanager`) from the Mimir (Prometheus) instance running in the Grafana Cloud Stack.

  The Cloud Alertmanager is available exclusively in Grafana Cloud and can handle both Grafana-managed and data source-managed alerts.

  Some Grafana Cloud services, such as **Kubernetes Monitoring** and **Synthetic Monitoring** use the Cloud Alertmanager to create and manage alerts.

- **Other Alertmanagers**: Grafana Alerting also supports sending alerts to other Alertmanagers, such as the [Prometheus Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/), which can handle both Grafana-managed and data source-managed alerts.

Grafana Alerting supports using a combination of Alertmanagers and can [enable other Alertmanagers to receive Grafana-managed alerts](#enable-an-alertmanager-to-receive-grafana-managed-alerts). The decision often depends on your alerting setup and where your alerts are generated.

For example, if you already have an Alertmanager running in your on-premises or cloud infrastructure to handle Prometheus alerts, you can forward Grafana-managed alerts to the same Alertmanager for unified notification handling.

## Add an Alertmanager

Alertmanagers should be configured as data sources using Grafana Configuration from the main Grafana navigation menu. To add an Alertmanager, complete the following steps.

{{< docs/shared lookup="alerts/add-alertmanager-ds.md" source="grafana" version="<GRAFANA_VERSION>" >}}

For provisioning instructions, refer to the [Alertmanager data source documentation](ref:alertmanager-data-source).

After adding an Alertmanager, you can use the Grafana Alerting UI to manage notification policies, contact points, silences, and other alerting resources from within Grafana.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
When using Prometheus, you can manage silences in the Grafana Alerting UI. However, other Alertmanager resources such as contact points, notification policies, and templates are read-only because the Prometheus Alertmanager HTTP API does not support updates for these resources.

When using multiple Alertmanagers, use the `Choose Alertmanager` dropdown to switch between Alertmanagers.

## Enable an Alertmanager to receive Grafana-managed alerts

After enabling **Receive Grafana Alerts** in the Data Source Settings, you must also configure the Alertmanager in the Alerting Settings page. Grafana supports enabling one or multiple Alertmanagers to receive all generated Grafana-managed alerts.

1. In the left-side menu, click **Alerts & IRM** and then **Alerting**.
1. Click **Settings** to view the list of configured Alertmanagers.
1. For the selected Alertmanager, click the **Enable/Disable** button to toggle receiving Grafana-managed alerts. When activated, the Alertmanager displays `Receiving Grafana-managed alerts`.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/alerting/grafana-alerting-settings.png" max-width="750px" alt="Grafana Alerting Settings page" >}}

All Grafana-managed alerts are forwarded to Alertmanagers marked as `Receiving Grafana-managed alerts`.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Grafana Alerting does not support forwarding Grafana-managed alerts to the AlertManager in Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. For more details, refer to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/64064).

## Manage Alertmanager configurations

On the Settings page, you can also manage your Alertmanager configurations.

- Manage version snapshots for the built-in Alertmanager, which allows administrators to roll back unintentional changes or mistakes in the Alertmanager configuration.
- Compare the historical snapshot with the latest configuration to see which changes were made.
