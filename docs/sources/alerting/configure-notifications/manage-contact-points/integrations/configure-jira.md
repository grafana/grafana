# Configure Jira for Alerting

Use the Jira integration in a contact point to create issues in your Jira instance when alerts fire. The integration supports both Jira Cloud and Jira Server/Data Center installations.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Jira instance (Cloud, Server, or Data Center)
- API access credentials for Jira
- Appropriate permissions to create issues in your target Jira project

## Configure Jira for a contact point

To create a contact point with a Jira integration, complete the following steps:

1. Navigate to **Alerts & IRM** -> **Alerting** -> **Contact points**.
2. Click **+ Add contact point**.
3. Enter a name for the contact point.
4. From the **Integration** list, select **Jira**.
5. Set up the required [settings](#required-settings) for your Jira configuration.
6. Click **Save contact point**.

For more details on contact points, including how to test them and enable notifications, refer to [Configure contact points](/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/manage-contact-points/).

| Basic Auth Password | Password or personal token. For Jira Cloud, you need to obtain a personal token [here](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) and use it as the password.                                                        |
| API Token           | An alternative to basic authentication, a bearer token is used to authorize the API requests. See [Jira documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html) for more information. |
| Project Key         | The project key identifying the project where issues will be created. Project keys are unique identifiers for a project.                                                                                                               |
| Issue Type          | The type of issue to create (e.g., `Task`, `Bug`, `Incident`). Make sure that you specify a type that is available in your project.                                                                                                    |

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title                   | The issue title. Supports templating. Max length is 255 characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Description             | The description of the issue. Depending on version of the API, it can be a text, Markdown, or JSON (v3 API only). Maximum size of the field is 32kb.<br>**Note:** JSON is not limited by the client, and if it exceeds the size, the API is likely to reject the request.                                             |
| Labels                  | Custom labels can be added to organize and filter issues created in Jira. Supports templating, allowing dynamic label generation based on alert data.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Priority                | The priority level of the issue (e.g., `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical`). <br>Ensure that the priority value matches the available options for your Jira instance. You can customize priority levels in Jira [here](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-priorities/).           |
| Resolve Transition      | The transition name to move the issue to a resolved state when an alert is resolved. Ensure that the value matches a valid transition available in your Jira workflow for the specified issue type. If this field is empty, the issue will not be transitioned to Done.                                               |
| Reopen Transition       | The transition name to move the issue back to an open state when an alert reoccurs. Ensure that the value matches a valid transition available in your Jira workflow for the specified issue type. If this field is empty, the issue will not be reopened.                                                            |
| Reopen Duration         | The time duration (in minutes) to control whether to reopen an issue that was closed within this duration or create a new one. If not specified, the most recent issue that matches the deduplication key will be updated and reopened (if reopen transition is specified).                                           |
| Ignored Resolution      | Specify a resolution status that should be ignored when searching for existing issues. For example, issues with this resolution will not be reopened or updated by subsequent alerts.                                                                                                                                 |
| Deduplication Key Field | Custom field to store the deduplication key. Must be a text field. <br> If not specified, the deduplication key is added to labels in the format of `ALERT(hash sum)`. See [Jira documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/create-a-custom-field/) for how to create custom fields. |
| Fields                  | Allows to configure custom fields of Jira issue. The field name should be of the format like `customfield_10001`.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
