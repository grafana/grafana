# Configure PagerDuty for Alerting

Use the Grafana Alerting - PagerDuty integration to receive notifications in PagerDuty when your alerts are firing.

## Before you begin

To set up PagerDuty for integration with Grafana Alerting, you need to create a [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) account. There are several set up steps to perform within PagerDuty before you set up the integration in Grafana Alerting.

### Create a Service

1. Refer to [PagerDuty’s services and integrations guide](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-service).

1. Follow steps 1 to 5 under **Create a Service**.
