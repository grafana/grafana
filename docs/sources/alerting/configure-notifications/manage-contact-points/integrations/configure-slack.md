## Configure Slack for Alerting

Use the Grafana Alerting - Slack integration to send Slack notifications when your alerts are firing. 

There are two ways of integrating Slack into Grafana Alerting. 
1. Use a [Slack API token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types)
Enable your app to access the Slack API. If, for example, you are interested in more granular control over permissions, or your project is expected to regularly scale, resulting in new channels being created, this is the best option. 

1. Use a [Webhook URL](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
Webhooks is the simpler way to post messages into Slack. Slack automatically creates a bot user with all the necessary permissions to post messages to one particular channel of your choice.

**Note:**

Grafana Alerting only allows one Slack channel per Contact point.

## Before you begin

### Slack API Token 

If you are using a Slack API Token, complete the following steps.

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 of the [Slack API Quickstart](https://api.slack.com/start/quickstart).
1. Add the [chat:write.public](https://api.slack.com/scopes/chat:write.public) scope to give your app the ability to post in all public channels without joining.
1. In OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace, copy the Bot User OAuth Token.
1. Open your Slack workplace.
1. Right click the channel you want to receive notifications in.
1. Click View channel details.
1. Scroll down and copy the Channel ID.

**Note:**

**Note:**

1. Navigate to Alerts&IRM ->  Alerting -> Contact points.
1. Click + Add contact point.
1. Enter a contact point name.
1. From the Integration list, select Slack.
1. If you are using a Slack API token:
- In the Recipient field, copy in the channel ID in the Recipient field.
- In the Token field, copy in the Bot User OAuth Token that starts with “xoxb-”.
6. If you are using a Webhook URL, in the Webhook field, copy in your Slack app Webhook URL.
7. Click **Test** to check that your integration works. 
8. Click **Save contact point**.

## Next steps

To add the contact point and integration you created to your default notification policy, complete the following steps.

1. Navigate to **Alerts&IRM** -> **Alerting** -> **Notification policies**.
1. In the **Default policy**, click  the ellipsis icon (…) and then **Edit**,
1. Change the default policy to the contact point you created.
1. Click **Update default policy**.

If you have more than one contact point, add a new notification policy rather than edit the default one, so you can route specific alerts to Slack. For more information, refer to Notification policies - [slack-integration][here]
