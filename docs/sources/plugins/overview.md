# Plugins

From Grafana 3.0 not only datsource plugins is supported but also panel plugins and apps. Having panels as plugins make it easy to create and add any kind of panel, to show your data or improve your favortie dashboards. Apps is something new in Grafana that enables bundling of datasources, panels that belongs together.

Grafana allready have a strong community of contributors and plugin developers. By making it easier to develop and install plugins we hope that the community can grow even stronger and develop new plugins that we would never think about.
