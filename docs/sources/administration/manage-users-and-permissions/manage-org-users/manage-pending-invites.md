# Manage a pending invitation

Periodically review invitations you have sent so that you can see a list of users that have not yet accepted the invitation or cancel a pending invitation.

> **Note:** The **Pending Invites** button is only visible if there are unanswered invitations.

## Before you begin

- Ensure you have organization administrator privileges

**To manage a pending invitation**:

1. Sign in to Grafana as an organization administrator.
1. Hover your cursor over the **Configuration** (gear) icon in the side menu and click **Users**.
1. Click **Pending Invites**.

   The **Pending Invites** button appears only when there are unaccepted invitations.

To cancel an invitation, click the red **X** next to the invitation.

To copy an invitation link and send it directly to a user, click Copy Invite. You can then paste the invite link into a message.
