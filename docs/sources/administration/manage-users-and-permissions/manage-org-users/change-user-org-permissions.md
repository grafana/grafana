# Change a user's organization permissions

Update user permissions when you want to enhance or restrict a user's access to organization resources. For more information about organization permissions, refer to [Organization roles]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions/#organization-roles" >}}).

## Before you begin

- Ensure you have organization administrator privileges

**To change the organization role of a user**:

1. Sign in to Grafana as an organization administrator.
1. Hover your cursor over the **Configuration** (gear) icon in the side menu and click **Users**.
1. Find the user account for which you want to change the role.

   If necessary, use the search field to filter the list.

1. Locate the user on the list and in the **Role** column, click the user role.
1. Select the role that you want to assign.
1. Click **Update**.

> **Note:** If you have [server administrator]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions.md#grafana-server-administrators" >}}) permissions, you can also [change a user's organization permissions]({{< relref "../../manage-users-and-permissions/manage-server-users/change-user-org-permissions.md" >}}) in the Server Admin section.
