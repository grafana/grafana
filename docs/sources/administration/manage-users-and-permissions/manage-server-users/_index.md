# Manage users globally

A _user_ is defined as any individual who can log in to Grafana. Each user is associated with a _role_ that includes _permissions_. Permissions determine the tasks a user can perform in the system.

If you have [server administrator]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions.md#grafana-server-administrators" >}}) permissions in Grafana, you can manage all users for a Grafana instance in the Server Admin section:

{{< section >}}

If you have [organization administrator]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions.md#organization-roles" >}}) permissions and _not_ [server administrator]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions.md#grafana-server-administrators" >}}) permissions, refer to [Manage users in a organization]({{< relref "../../manage-users-and-permissions/manage-org-users/_index.md" >}}).

For more information about users and permissions, refer to [About users and permissions]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions" >}}).
