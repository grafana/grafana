**To modify your Grafana Enterprise subscription in AWS Marketplace:**

1. Update your license.

1. Sign in to Grafana as a Server Administrator.

1. Hover over **Server Admin** in the navigation bar and click **Statistics and Licensing**.

   This action retrieves updated license information from AWS.
