# Plugin signatures

Plugin signature verification, also known as _signing_, is a security measure to make sure plugins haven't been tampered with. Upon loading, Grafana checks to see if a plugin is signed or unsigned when inspecting and verifying its digital signature.

Learn more at [plugin policies](https://grafana.com/legal/plugins/).

## How does verifiction work?

At startup, Grafana verifies the signatures of every plugin in the plugin directory.

To see the result of this verification for each plugin, navigate to **Configuration** -> **Plugins**. A signature can have any of the following signature status:

| Signature status   | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core               | Core plugin built into Grafana.                                                 |
| Invalid signature  | The plugin has an invalid signature.                                            |
| Modified signature | The plugin has changed since it was signed. This may indicate malicious intent. |
| Unsigned           | The plugin is not signed.                                                       |
| Signed             | The plugin signature was successfully verified.                                 |

### What happens if a plugin is not signed?

If a plugin is unsigned, then Grafana neither loads nor starts it. Grafana also writes an error message to the server log:

```bash
WARN[05-26|12:00:00] Some plugin scanning errors were found   errors="plugin '<plugin id>' is unsigned, plugin '<plugin id>' has an invalid signature"
```

## Plugin signature levels

All plugins are signed under a _signature level_. The signature level determines how the plugin can be distributed.

| **Plugin Level** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

## Allow unsigned plugins

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Unsigned plugins are not supported in Grafana Cloud.
{{< /admonition >}}

We strongly recommend that you don't run unsigned plugins in your Grafana instance. However, if you're aware of the risks and you still want to load an unsigned plugin, refer to [Configuration](/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#allow_loading_unsigned_plugins).

If you've allowed loading of an unsigned plugin, then Grafana writes a warning message to the server log:

```bash
WARN[06-01|16:45:59] Running an unsigned plugin   pluginID=<plugin id>
```

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
If you're developing a plugin, then you can enable development mode to allow all unsigned plugins.

## Sign a plugin you've developed

If you are a plugin developer and want to know how to sign your plugin, refer to [Sign a plugin](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/publish-a-plugin/sign-a-plugin).
