# Grafana Advisor

{{< docs/experimental product="Grafana Advisor" featureFlag="grafanaAdvisor" >}}

## Overview

Grafana Advisor is a monitoring tool that helps administrators keep their Grafana instances running smoothly and securely. It automatically performs regular health checks on your Grafana server, providing actionable insights and recommendations for maintaining optimal system performance.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Currently, Grafana Advisor performs regular checks on data sources, plugins, and your Grafana instance, but we're planning to expand its capabilities in future releases to cover more aspects of your Grafana environment.

You can suggest new checks and provide feedback through this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8T-xMZauFXZ1uHw09OjZLT_AaiY-cl-hJGwC6Krkj0ThmZQ/viewform).

## Before you begin

To set up Grafana Advisor you need:

- Administration rights in your Grafana organization.
- If you're running Grafana on-premise, enable the required feature toggle in your Grafana instance. Refer to [Enable required feature toggles](#enable-feature-toggles) for instructions. This is not required if you're using Grafana Cloud, as the feature toggles are enabled by default.

### Enable feature toggles

To activate Grafana Advisor, you need to enable the `grafanaAdvisor` feature toggle. This will automatically install the Grafana Advisor application to your server if it's not already installed. For additional information about feature toggles, refer to [Configure feature toggles](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/feature-toggles/).

To enable the required feature toggles, add them to your Grafana configuration file:

1. Open your Grafana configuration file, either `grafana.ini` or `custom.ini`. For file location based on the operating system, refer to Configuration file location.
1. Locate or add a `[feature_toggles]` section. Add this value:

   ```ini
   [feature_toggles]
   grafanaAdvisor = true
   ```

1. Save the changes to the file and restart Grafana.

## Access Grafana Advisor

1. Log in to your Grafana instance with an administrator account
1. Navigate to the Administration section
1. Select "Advisor" from the navigation menu

### Investigation needed section

This collapsible section provides information on issues that may not require immediate action but require your attention. For example, it provides information on plugins that require an upgrade. Similar to the "Action needed" section, clicking an item opens the plugin's upgrade page. From there, you can either update to the latest version or select a specific version from the version history tab.
