# Server user management

A _user_ is defined as any individual who can log in to Grafana. Each user is associated with a _role_ that includes _permissions_. Permissions determine the tasks a user can perform in the system.

If you have [server administrator](../../roles-and-permissions/#grafana-server-administrators) permissions in Grafana, you can manage all users for a Grafana instance in the Server Admin section:

{{< section >}}

If you have [organization administrator](../../roles-and-permissions/#organization-roles) permissions and _not_ [server administrator](../../roles-and-permissions/#grafana-server-administrators) permissions, refer to [Manage users in a organization](../manage-org-users/).

For more information about user roles and permissions, refer to [Roles and permissions](../../roles-and-permissions/). For more information about managing users in general, see [User management](../).

## View a list of users

You can see a list of users with accounts on your Grafana server. This action might be useful when you want to know which role you assigned to each user.

### Before you begin

- Ensure you have Grafana server administrator privileges

**To view a list of users**:

1. Sign in to Grafana as a server administrator.
1. Click **Administration** in the left-side menu, **Users and access**, and then **Users**.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If you have [organization administrator](../../roles-and-permissions/#organization-roles) permissions and _not_ [server administrator](../../roles-and-permissions/#grafana-server-administrators) permissions, you can still [view of list of users in a given organization](../manage-org-users/#view-a-list-of-organization-users).

A user account contains the following sections.

#### User information

This section contains basic user information, which users can update.

#### Permissions

This indicates whether the user account has the Grafana administrator flag applied. If the flag is set to **Yes**, then the user is a Grafana server administrator.

#### Organizations

This section lists the organizations the user belongs to and their assigned role.

#### Sessions

This section includes recent user sessions and information about the time the user logged in and they system they used. You can force logouts, if necessary.

Edit a user account when you want to modify user login credentials, or delete, disable, or enable a user.

### Before you begin

- Ensure you have Grafana server administrator privileges

**To edit a user account**:

1. Sign in to Grafana as a server administrator.
1. Click **Administration** in the left-side menu, **Users and access**, and then **Users**.
1. Click a user.
1. Complete any of the following actions, as necessary.

| Action                          | Description                                                                                                                                                     |

| Change the user's password      | The new password must be at least four characters long. Click **Save** after you make a change.                                                                 |
| Delete a user                   | This action permanently removes the user from the Grafana server. The user can no longer sign in after you make this change.                                    |
| Disable user account            | This action prevents a user from signing in with this account, but does not delete the account. You might disable an account if a colleague goes on sabbatical. |
| Enable a user account           | This action enables a user account.                                                                                                                             |

## Add a user

Add users when you want to manually provide individuals with access to Grafana.

When you create a user using this method, you must create their password. The user does not receive a notification by email. To invite a user to Grafana and allow them to create their own password, [invite a user to join an organization](../manage-org-users/#invite-a-user-to-join-an-organization).

When you configure advanced authentication using Oauth, SAML, LDAP, or the Auth proxy, users are created automatically.

### Before you begin

- Ensure that you have Grafana server administrator privileges

**To add a user**:

1. Sign in to Grafana as a server administrator.
1. Click **Administration** in the left-side menu, **Users and access**, and then **Users**.
1. Click **New user**.
1. Complete the fields and click **Create user**.

When you create a user, the system assigns the user viewer permissions in a default organization, which you can change. You can now [add a user to a second organization](add-remove-user-to-org/).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If you have [organization administrator](../../roles-and-permissions/#organization-roles) permissions and _not_ [server administrator](../../roles-and-permissions/#grafana-server-administrators) permissions, you can still add users by [inviting a user to join an organization](../manage-org-users/#invite-a-user-to-join-an-organization).

## Force a user to log out of Grafana

### Before you begin

- Ensure you have Grafana server administrator privileges

1. Sign in to Grafana as a server administrator.
1. Click **Administration** in the left-side menu, **Users and access**, and then **Users**.
1. Click a user.

1. Perform one of the following actions:
   - Click **Force logout** next to the session entry that you want logged out of Grafana.
