# Manage users in an organization

Organization administrators can invite users to join their organization. Organization users have access to organization resources based on their role, which is **Admin**, **Editor**, or **Viewer**. Permissions associated with each role determine the tasks a user can perform in the system.

For more information about organization user permissions, refer to [Organization users and permissions](../../roles-and-permissions/#organization-users-and-permissions).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Users added at the organization level will have access to all stacks and services by default, without the ability to be filtered by stack unless Single Sign-On (SSO) or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented.

## View a list of organization users

You can see a list of users with accounts in your Grafana organization. If necessary, you can use the search field to filter the list.

### Before you begin

- Ensure you have organization administrator privileges

**To view a list of organization users**:

1. Sign in to Grafana as an organization administrator.
1. Navigate to **Administration > Users and access > Users**.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If you have [server administrator](../../roles-and-permissions/#grafana-server-administrators) permissions, you can also [view a global list of users](../server-user-management/#view-a-list-of-users) in the Server Admin section of Grafana.
{{% /admonition %}}

## Change a user's organization permissions

Update user permissions when you want to enhance or restrict a user's access to organization resources. For more information about organization permissions, refer to [Organization roles](../../roles-and-permissions/#organization-roles).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Organization roles sync from the authentication provider on user sign-in. To prevent synchronization of organization roles from the authentication provider regardless of their role in the authentication provider, then refer to the `skip_org_role_sync` setting in your Grafana configuration. Refer to [skip org role sync](../../../setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#authgrafana_com-skip_org_role_sync) for more information.

### Before you begin

- Ensure you have organization administrator privileges

**To change the organization role of a user**:

1. Sign in to Grafana as an organization administrator.
1. Navigate to **Administration > Users and access > Users**.
1. Find the user account for which you want to change the role.

   If necessary, use the search field to filter the list.

1. Locate the user on the list and in the **Role** column, click the user role.
1. Select the role that you want to assign.
1. Click **Update**.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If you have [server administrator](../../roles-and-permissions/#grafana-server-administrators) permissions, you can also [change a user's organization permissions](../server-user-management/change-user-org-permissions/) in the Server Admin section.
{{% /admonition %}}

## Invite a user to join an organization

When you invite users to join an organization, you assign the **Admin**, **Editor**, or **Viewer** role, or select **No basic role**. Organization roles control user access to resources, such as dashboards and data sources, owned by the organization. Users receive an email that prompts them to accept the invitation.

- If you know that the user already has access Grafana and you know their user name, then you issue an invitation by entering their user name.
- If the user is new to Grafana, then use their email address to issue an invitation. The system automatically creates the user account on first sign in.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If you have [server administrator](../../roles-and-permissions/#grafana-server-administrators) permissions, you can also manually [add a user to an organization](../server-user-management/add-remove-user-to-org/).
{{% /admonition %}}

### Before you begin

- Ensure you have organization administrator privileges.
- If the user already has access to Grafana, obtain their user name.
- Determine the permissions you want to assign to the user. For more information about organization permissions, refer to [Organization roles](../../roles-and-permissions/#organization-roles).

**To invite or add an existing user account to your organization**:

1. Sign in to Grafana as an organization administrator.
1. To switch to the organization to which you want to invite a user, hover your mouse over your profile and click **Switch organization** and select an organization.

   > **Note**: It might be that you are currently in the proper organization and don't need to switch organizations.

## Manage a pending invitation

Periodically review invitations you have sent so that you can see a list of users that have not yet accepted the invitation or cancel a pending invitation.

You can remove a user from an organization when they no longer require access to the dashboard or data sources owned by the organization. No longer requiring access to an organization might occur when the user has left your company or has internally moved to another organization.
