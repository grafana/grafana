# Correlations

You can create interactive links for Explore visualizations by setting up Correlations. These links can either run queries or generate external URLs related to presented data.

A correlation defines how data in one [data source]({{< relref "../../datasources" >}}) is used to query data in another data source or to generate an external URL.
Some examples:

- an application name returned in a logs data source can be used to query metrics related to that application in a metrics data source, or
- a user name returned by an SQL data source can be used to query logs related to that particular user in a logs data source
- a customer ID in a logs data source can link to a different platform that has a profile on that customer.

[Explore]({{< relref "../../explore" >}}) takes user-defined correlations to display links inside the visualizations.
If a correlation links to a query, you can click on that link to run the related query and see results in [Explore Split View]({{< relref "../../explore#split-and-compare" >}}).
If a correlation links to an external URL, you can click on the link to open the URL in a new tab in your browser.

Explore visualizations that currently support showing links based on correlations:

- [Logs Panel]({{< relref "./use-correlations-in-visualizations#correlations-in-logs-panel">}})
- [Table]({{< relref "./use-correlations-in-visualizations#correlations-in-table">}})

You can configure correlations using [provisioning]({{< relref "../provisioning" >}}), the **Administration > Plugins and data > Correlations** page in Grafana or directly in [Explore]({{< relref "../../explore/correlations-editor-in-explore" >}}).

## Example of how links work in Explore once set up
