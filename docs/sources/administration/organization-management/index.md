# Manage organizations

This topic describes what organizations are, and how to create, edit, and delete them.

## About organizations

An organization is an entity that helps you isolate users and resources such as dashboards, annotations, and data sources from each other. Their purpose is to provide completely separate experiences, which look like multiple instances of Grafana, within a single instance. Multiple organizations are easier and cheaper to manage than multiple instances of Grafana.

Users, configuration settings, and Grafana Enterprise licenses are shared between organizations. Other resources, like dashboards, data sources, annotations, folders, Teams, and Alerts, are isolated within each organization and cannot be easily shared with another organization.

The following table summarizes the resources you can share and/or isolate using organizations.

| Resource                 | Mode             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Users                    | Share or isolate |
| Folders                  | Isolate only     |
| Dashboards               | Isolate only     |
| Data sources             | Isolate only     |
| Alerts                   | Isolate only     |
| Notification channels    | Isolate only     |
| Annotations              | Isolate only     |
| Reports                  | Isolate only     |
| API keys                 | Isolate only     |
| Authentication providers | Share only       |
| Configuration settings   | Share only       |
| Licenses                 | Share            |

The member of one organization cannot view dashboards assigned to another organization. However, a user can belong to multiple organizations.

Grafana Server Administrators are responsible for creating organizations. For more information about the Grafana Server Administrator role, refer to [Grafana server administrators](../roles-and-permissions/#grafana-server-administrators).
