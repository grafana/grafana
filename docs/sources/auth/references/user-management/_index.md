# User management

A _user_ is defined as any individual who can log in to Grafana. Each user is associated with a _role_ that includes _permissions_. Permissions determine the tasks a user can perform in the system. For example, the **Admin** role includes permissions for an administrator to create and delete users.

The following topics describe how to use permissions to control user access to data sources, dashboards, users, and teams.
