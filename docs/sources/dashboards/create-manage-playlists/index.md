# Manage playlists

A _playlist_ is a list of dashboards that are displayed in a sequence. You might use a playlist to build situational awareness or to present your metrics to your team or visitors.

Grafana automatically scales dashboards to any resolution, which makes them perfect for big screens.

You can access the Playlist feature from Grafana's side menu, in the Dashboards submenu.

## Access, share, and control a playlist

Use the information in this section to access playlists. Start and control the display of a playlist using one of the six available modes.

### Access a playlist

1. Click **Dashboards** in the main menu.
1. Click **Playlists** to see a list of playlists.

### Start a playlist

You can start a playlist in six different view modes. View modes determine how the menus and navigation bar appear on the dashboards as well as how panels are sized.

1. Click **Dashboards** in the main menu.
1. Click **Playlists**.
1. Find the desired playlist and click **Start playlist**.
1. In the dialog box that opens, select one of the [six playlist modes](#playlist-modes) available.
1. Disable any dashboard controls that you don't want displayed while the list plays; these controls are enabled and visible by default. Select from:

   - **Time and refresh**
   - **Variables**
   - **Dashboard links**

1. Click **Start \<playlist name\>**.

The playlist displays each dashboard for the time specified in the **Interval** field, set when creating or editing a playlist. After a playlist starts, you can [control](#control-a-playlist) it using the navbar at the top of your screen.
