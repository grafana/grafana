# Manage users

Create users and teams and configure [Permissions]({{< relref "../permissions/overview.md" >}}) to make sure that users only have access to the resources they need.

Only Administrators can manage users and teams.

## Users

Users are named accounts in Grafana that can be granted permissions to access resources throughout Grafana.

- [Add or remove a user]({{< relref "./add-or-remove-user.md" >}})
- [Enable or disable a user]({{< relref "./enable-or-disable-user.md" >}})

## Teams

Teams allow you to grant permissions for a group of users.

- [Create or remove a team]({{< relref "./create-or-remove-team.md" >}})
- [Add or remove a user from a team]({{< relref "./add-or-remove-user-from-team.md" >}})
