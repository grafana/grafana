# Grizzly (deprecated)

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
Grizzly has been removed. It is no longer deployed, enhanced, or supported.

Use the [Grafana CLI](/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/observability-as-code/grafana-cli/) instead.
{{< /admonition >}}

[Grizzly](https://grafana.github.io/grizzly/) is a command line tool that allows you to manage your observability resources with code. You can use it to manage dashboards, data sources, Prometheus rules, and Synthetic monitoring.
