# Unlink a Grafana library panel

To unlink a library panel from a dashboard:

1. Hover over **Dashboard** on the left menu, and then click **Library panels**.
1. Select a library panel that is being used in different dashboards. You will see a list of all the dashboards where the library panel is used.
