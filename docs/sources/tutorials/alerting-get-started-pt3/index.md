# Get started with Grafana Alerting - Part 3 of 4

The Get started with Grafana Alerting tutorial Part 3 is a continuation of [Get started with Grafana Alerting tutorial Part 2](http://www.grafana.com/tutorials/alerting-get-started-pt2/).

Grouping in Grafana Alerting reduces notification noise by combining related alert instances into a single, concise notification. This is useful for on-call engineers, ensuring they focus on resolving incidents instead of sorting through a flood of notifications.

Grouping is configured using labels in the notification policy. These labels reference those generated by alert instances or configured by the user.

Notification policies also allow you to define how often notifications are sent for each group of alert instances.

In this tutorial, you will:

- Learn how alert rule grouping works.
- Create a notification policy to handle grouping.
- Define alert rules for a real-world scenario.
- Receive and review grouped alert notifications.

## Set up the Grafana stack

{{< /docs/ignore >}}

## Before you begin

There are different ways you can follow along with this tutorial.

- **Grafana Cloud**

  - As a Grafana Cloud user, you don't have to install anything. [Create your free account](http://www.grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user).

  Continue to [How alert rule grouping works](#how-alert-rule-grouping-works).

- **Interactive learning environment**

  - Alternatively, you can try out this example in our interactive learning environment: [Get started with Grafana Alerting - Part 3](https://killercoda.com/grafana-labs/course/grafana/alerting-get-started-pt3/). It's a fully configured environment with all the dependencies already installed.

- **Grafana OSS**

  - If you opt to run a Grafana stack locally, ensure you have the following applications installed:

  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (included in Docker for Desktop for macOS and Windows)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Set up the Grafana stack (OSS users)

<!-- INTERACTIVE ignore END -->

To demonstrate the observation of data using the Grafana stack, download and run the following files.

1. Clone the [tutorial environment repository](https://www.github.com/grafana/tutorial-environment).

   <!-- INTERACTIVE exec START -->

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/grafana/tutorial-environment.git
   ```

   <!-- INTERACTIVE exec END -->

1. Change to the directory where you cloned the repository:

   <!-- INTERACTIVE exec START -->

   ```
   cd tutorial-environment
   ```

   <!-- INTERACTIVE exec END -->

1. Run the Grafana stack:

   <!-- INTERACTIVE ignore START -->

   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   <!-- INTERACTIVE ignore END -->

   {{< docs/ignore >}}

   <!-- INTERACTIVE exec START -->

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   <!-- INTERACTIVE exec END -->

   {{< /docs/ignore >}}

   The first time you run `docker compose up -d`, Docker downloads all the necessary resources for the tutorial. This might take a few minutes, depending on your internet connection.

   <!-- INTERACTIVE ignore START -->

   {{< admonition type="note" >}}
   If you already have Grafana, Loki, or Prometheus running on your system, you might see errors, because the Docker image is trying to use ports that your local installations are already using. If this is the case, stop the services, then run the command again.

## How alert rule grouping works

Alert notification grouping is configured with **labels** and **timing options**:

- **Labels** map the alert rule with the notification policy and define the grouping.
- **Timing options** control when and how often notifications are sent.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/alerting/alerting-notification-policy-diagram-with-labels-v3.png" max-width="750px" alt="A diagram about the components of a notification policy, including labels and groups" >}}

### Types of Labels

**Reserved labels** (default):

- Automatically generated by Grafana, e.g., `alertname`, `grafana_folder`.
- Example: `alertname="High CPU usage"`.

**User-configured labels**:

- Added manually to the alert rule.
- Example: `severity`, `priority`.

**Query labels**:

- Returned by the data source query.
- Example: `region`, `service`, `environment`.

### Timing Options

**Group wait**: Time before sending the first notification.
**Group interval**: Time between notifications for a group.
**Repeat interval**: Time before resending notifications for an unchanged group.

Alerts sharing the **same label values** are grouped together, and timing options determine notification frequency.

For more details, see:

- [Grouping Alerts](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/fundamentals/notifications/group-alert-notifications/)
- [Alert Labels](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/fundamentals/alert-rules/annotation-label/#label-types)

## A real-world example of alert grouping in action

### Scenario: monitoring a distributed application

You’re monitoring metrics like CPU usage, memory utilization, and network latency across multiple regions. Some of these alert rules include labels such as `region: us-west` and `region: us-east`. If multiple alert rules trigger across these regions, they can result in notification floods.

### How to manage grouping

To group alert rule notifications:

1. **Define labels**: Use `region`, `metric`, or `instance` labels to categorize alerts.
1. **Configure Notification policies**:
   - Group alerts by the **query label** "region".
   - Example:
     - Alert notifications for `region: us-west` go to the West Coast team.
     - Alert notifications for `region: us-east` go to the East Coast team.
1. Specify the **timing options** for sending notifications to control their frequency.
   - Example:
     - **Group interval**: setting determines how often updates for the same alert group are sent. By default, this interval is set to 5 minutes, but you can customize it to be shorter or longer based on your needs.

<!-- INTERACTIVE page step4.md START -->

## Setting up alert rule grouping

### Notification Policy

Following the above example, [notification policies](ref:notification-policies) are created to route alert instances, which have a region label, to a specific contact point. The goal is to receive one consolidated notification per region. To demonstrate how grouping works, alert notifications for the East Coast team are not grouped. Regarding timing, a specific schedule is defined for that region. This setup overrides the parent's settings to fine-tune the behavior for specific labels (i.e., regions).

<!-- INTERACTIVE ignore START -->

1. Sign in to Grafana:

   - **Grafana Cloud** users: Log in via Grafana Cloud.
   - **OSS users**: Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

1. Navigate to **Notification Policies**:

   - Go to **Alerts & IRM > Alerting > Notification Policies**.

1. Add a child policy:

   - In the Default policy, click **+ New child policy**.
   - **Label**: `region`
   - **Operator**: `=`
   - **Value**: `us-west`

     This label matches alert rules where the region label is us-west.

1. Choose a **Contact point**:

   - Select **Webhook**.

   If you don’t have any contact points, add a [Contact point](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/configure-notifications/manage-contact-points/#add-a-contact-point).

1. Enable Continue matching:

   - Turn on **Continue matching subsequent sibling nodes** so the evaluation continues even after one or more labels (i.e. region label) match.

1. Override grouping settings:

   - Toggle **Override grouping**.
   - **Group by**: Add `region` as label. Remove any existing labels.

     **Group by** consolidates alerts that share the same grouping label into a single notification. For example, all alerts with `region=us-west` will be combined into one notification, making it easier to manage and reducing alert fatigue.

1. Set custom timing:

   - Toggle **Override general timings**.
   - **Group interval**: `2m`. This ensures follow-up notifications for the same alert group will be sent at intervals of 2 minutes. While the default is 5 minutes, we chose 2 minutes here to provide faster feedback for demonstration purposes.

     **Timing options** control how often notifications are sent and can help balance timely alerting with minimizing noise.

1. Save and repeat:

   - Repeat the steps above for `region = us-east` but without overriding grouping and timing options. Use a different webhook endpoint as the contact point.

   {{< figure src="/media/docs/alerting/notificaiton-policies-region.png" max-width="750px" alt="Two nested notification policies to route and group alert notifications" >}}

   These nested policies should route alert instances where the region label is either us-west or us-east. Only the us-west region team should receive grouped alert notifications.

   {{< admonition type="note" >}}
   In Grafana, each label within a notification policy must have a unique key. If you attempt to add the same label key (e.g., region) with different values (us-west and us-east), only the last entry is saved, and the previous one is discarded. This is because labels are stored as associative arrays (maps), where each key must be unique.
   For identical label keys use regex matchers (e.g., _region=~"us-west|us-east"_).
   {{</ admonition >}}

<!-- INTERACTIVE ignore END -->

{{< docs/ignore >}}

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where Grafana should be running
1. Navigate to **Alerts & IRM > Alerting > Notification policies**.
1. In the Default policy, click **+ New child policy**.

   - In the Default policy, click **+ New child policy**.
   - **Label**: `region`
   - **Operator**: `=`
   - **Value**: `us-west`

   This label matches alert rules where the region label is us-west

1. Choose a **Contact point**:

   - Select **Webhook**.

   If you don’t have any contact points, add a Contact point.

1. Enable Continue matching:

   - Turn on **Continue matching subsequent sibling nodes** so the evaluation continues even after one or more labels (i.e. region label) match.

1. Override grouping settings:

   - Toggle **Override grouping**.
   - **Group by**: `region`.

     **Group by** consolidates alerts that share the same grouping label into a single notification. For example, all alerts with `region=us-west` will be combined into one notification, making it easier to manage and reducing alert fatigue.

1. Set custom timing:

   - Toggle **Override general timings**.
   - **Group interval**: `2m`. This ensures follow-up notifications for the same alert group will be sent at intervals of 2 minutes. While the default is 5 minutes, we chose 2 minutes here to provide faster feedback for demonstration purposes.

     **Timing options** control how often notifications are sent and can help balance timely alerting with minimizing noise.

1. Save and repeat:

   - Repeat for `region = us-east` with a different webhook or a different contact point.

     **Note**: In Grafana, each label within a notification policy must have a unique key. If you attempt to add the same label key (e.g., region) with different values (us-west and us-east), only the last entry is saved, and the previous one is discarded. This is because labels are stored as associative arrays (maps), where each key must be unique.
     For identical label keys use regex matchers (e.g., _region=~"us-west|us-east"_).

## Create an alert rule

In this section we configure an alert rule based on our application monitoring example.

1. Navigate to **Alerts & IRM > Alerting > Alert rules**.
2. Click **New alert rule**.

### Enter an alert rule name

Make it short and descriptive as this appears in your alert notification. For instance, `High CPU usage - Multi-region`.

### Define query and alert condition

In this section, we use the default options for Grafana-managed alert rule creation. The default options let us define the query, a expression (used to manipulate the data -- the `WHEN` field in the UI), and the condition that must be met for the alert to be triggered (in default mode is the threshold).

Grafana includes a [test data source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/testdata/) that creates simulated time series data. This data source is included in the demo environment for this tutorial. If you're working in Grafana Cloud or your own local Grafana instance, you can add the data source through the **Connections** menu.

1. From the drop-down menu, select **TestData** data source.
1. From **Scenario** select **CSV Content**.
1. Copy in the following CSV data:

   - Select **TestData** as the data source.
   - Set **Scenario** to **CSV Content**.
   - Use the following CSV data:

     ```csv
     region,cpu-usage,service,instance
     us-west,35,web-server-1,server-01
     us-west,81,web-server-1,server-02
     us-east,79,web-server-2,server-03
     us-east,52,web-server-2,server-04
     us-west,45,db-server-1,server-05
     us-east,77,db-server-2,server-06
     us-west,82,db-server-1,server-07
     us-east,93,db-server-2,server-08
     ```

   The returned data simulates a data source returning multiple time series, each leading to the creation of an alert instance for that specific time series.

1. In the **Alert condition** section:

   - Keep `Last` as the value for the reducer function (`WHEN`), and `75` as the threshold value. This is the value above which the alert rule should trigger.

1. Click **Preview alert rule condition** to run the queries.

   It should return 5 series in Firing state, two firing instances from the us-west region, and three from the us-east region.

   {{< figure src="/media/docs/alerting/regions-alert-instance-preview.png" max-width="750px" alt="Preview of a query returning alert instances." >}}

### Add folders and labels

1. In **Folder**, click **+ New folder** and enter a name. For example: `Multi-region alerts` . This folder contains our alert rules.

### Set evaluation behavior

Every alert rule is assigned to an evaluation group. You can assign the alert rule to an existing evaluation group or create a new one.

1. In the **Evaluation group and interval**, repeat the above step to create a new evaluation group. Name it `Multi-region group`.
1. Choose an **Evaluation interval** (how often the alert are evaluated). Choose `1m`.
1. Set the **pending period** to `0s` (zero seconds), so the alert rule fires the moment the condition is met (this minimizes the waiting time for the demonstration).

### Configure notifications

Select who should receive a notification when an alert rule fires.

1. Select **Use notification policy**.
1. Click **Preview routing** to ensure correct matching.

   {{< figure src="/media/docs/alerting/region-notification-policy-routing-preview.png" max-width="750px" alt="Preview of alert instance routing with the region label matcher" >}}

   The preview should show that the region label from our data source is successfully matching the notification policies that we created earlier thanks to the label matcher that we configured.

1. Click **Save rule and exit**.

### Create a second alert rule

Repeat the steps above to create a second alert rule that alerts on high memory usage.

1. Duplicate the alert rule by clicking on **More > Duplicate**.
1. Name it `High Memory usage - Multi-region`.
1. Use the below CSV data to simulate a data source returning memory usage.

   ```
   region,memory-usage,service,instance
   us-west,42,cache-server-1,server-09
   us-west,88,cache-server-1,server-10
   us-east,74,api-server-1,server-11
   us-east,90,api-server-1,server-12
   us-west,53,analytics-server-1,server-13
   us-east,81,analytics-server-2,server-14
   us-west,77,analytics-server-1,server-15
   us-east,94,analytics-server-2,server-16
   ```

1. Click Save rule and exit.

<!-- INTERACTIVE page step5.md END -->
<!-- INTERACTIVE page step6.md START -->

## Receiving grouped alert notifications

Now that the alert rules have been configured, you should receive alert notifications in the contact point(s) whenever alerts trigger.

When the configured alert rule detects CPU or memory usage higher than 75% across multiple regions, it will evaluate the metric every minute. If the condition persists, notifications will be grouped together, with a Group wait of 30 seconds before the first alert is sent. Follow-up notifications for the same alert group will be sent at intervals of 2 minutes (US-west alert instances only), increasing the frequency of the grouped alert notifications. US-east instances follow-up notifications should be sent at the default interval of 5 minutes. If the condition continues for an extended period, a Repeat interval of 4 hours ensures that the alert is only resent if the issue persists.

As a result, our notification policies should route three notifications: one grouped notification grouping both CPU and memory alert instances from the us-west region and two separate notifications with alert instances from the us-east region.

Grouped notifications example:

```json
{
  "receiver": "US-West-Alerts",
  "status": "firing",
  "alerts": [
    {
      "status": "firing",
      "labels": {
        "alertname": "High CPU usage - Multi-region",
        "grafana_folder": "Multi-region alerts",
        "instance": "server-05",
...
  {
    "status": "firing",
      "labels": {
        "alertname": "High Memory usage - Multi-region",
        "grafana_folder": "Multi-region alerts",
        "instance": "server-10",
      },

...}
```

## Conclusion

By configuring **notification policies** and using **labels** (such as _region_), you can group alert notifications based on specific criteria and route them to the appropriate teams. Fine-tuning **timing options**—including group wait, group interval, and repeat interval—further can reduce noise and ensures notifications remain actionable without overwhelming on-call engineers.
