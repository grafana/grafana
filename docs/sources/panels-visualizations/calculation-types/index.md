# Calculation types

The following table contains a list of calculations you can perform in Grafana. You can find these calculations in the **Transform** tab and in the bar gauge, gauge, and stat visualizations.

| Calculation        | Description                                               |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| All nulls          | True when all values are null                             |
| All zeros          | True when all values are 0                                |
| Change count       | Number of times the field's value changes                 |
| Count              | Number of values in a field                               |
| Delta              | Cumulative change in value, only counts increments        |
| Difference         | Difference between first and last value of a field        |
| Difference percent | Percentage change between first and last value of a field |
| Distinct count     | Number of unique values in a field                        |
| First (not null)   | First, not null value in a field                          |
| Max                | Maximum value of a field                                  |
| Mean               | Mean value of all values in a field                       |
| Variance           | Variance of all values in a field                         |
| StdDev             | Standard deviation of all values in a field               |
| Min                | Minimum value of a field                                  |
| Min (above zero)   | Minimum, positive value of a field                        |
| Range              | Difference between maximum and minimum values of a field  |
| Step               | Minimal interval between values of a field                |
| Total              | Sum of all values in a field                              |
