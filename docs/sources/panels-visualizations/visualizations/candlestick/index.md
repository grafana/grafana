# Candlestick

The candlestick visualization allows you to visualize data that includes a number of consistent dimensions focused on price movements, such as stock prices. The candlestick visualization includes an [Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) mode](#open-high-low-close), as well as support for additional dimensions based on time series data.

Candlestick visualizations build upon the foundation of the [time series visualization](ref:time-series-visualization) and include many common configuration settings.

You can use a candlestick if you want to visualize, at a glance, how a price moved over time, whether it went up, down, or stayed the same, and how much it fluctuated:

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/screenshot-candlestick-v11.6.png" max-width="750px" alt="A candlestick visualization" >}}

Each candlestick is represented as a rectangle, referred to as the _candlestick body_. The candlestick body displays the opening and closing prices during a time period. Green candlesticks represent when the price appreciated while the red candlesticks represent when the price depreciated. The lines sticking out the candlestick body are referred to as _wicks_ or _shadows_, which represent the highest and lowest prices during the time period.

Use a candlestick when you need to:

- Monitor and identify trends in price movements of specific assets such as stocks, currencies, or commodities.
- Analyze any volatility in the stock market.
- Provide data analysis to help with trading decisions.

## Configure a candlestick

Once youâ€™ve created a [dashboard](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/dashboards/build-dashboards/create-dashboard/), the following video shows you how to configure a candlestick visualization:

{{< youtube id="IOFKBgbf3aM" >}}

{{< docs/play title="Candlestick" url="https://play.grafana.org/d/candlestick/candlestick" >}}

## Supported data formats

The candlestick visualization works best with price movement data for an asset. The data must include:

- **Timestamps** - The time at which each price movement occurred.
- **Opening price** - The price of the asset at the beginning of the time period.
- **Closing price** - The price of the asset at the end of the time period.
- **Highest price** - The highest price the asset reached during the time period.
- **Lowest price** - The lowest price the asset reached during the time period.

### Example

| Timestamps          | Open  | High  | Low   | Close |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2024-03-13 10:05:00 | 0.200 | 0.205 | 0.201 | 0.203 |
| 2024-03-14 10:10:10 | 0.204 | 0.205 | 0.201 | 0.200 |
| 2024-03-15 10:15:10 | 0.204 | 0.205 | 0.201 | 0.200 |
| 2024-03-16 10:20:11 | 0.203 | 0.203 | 0.202 | 0.203 |
| 2024-03-17 10:25:11 | 0.203 | 0.203 | 0.202 | 0.203 |
| 2024-03-18 10:30:12 | 0.202 | 0.202 | 0.201 | 0.201 |

The data is converted as follows:

### Candlestick options

The following options let you control which data is displayed in the visualization and how it appears:

| Option                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mode                                                   | Controls which dimensions are used for the visualization. Choose from:<ul><li>**Candles** - Uses the open, high, low, and close dimensions.</li><li>**Volume** - Uses only the volume dimension.</li><li>**Both** - The default behavior, which displays both candles and volume values.</li></ul>    |
| Candle style                                           | Controls the appearance of the candles. Choose from:<ul><li>**Candles** - The default display style, which creates candle-style markers between the open and close dimensions.</li><li>**OHLC Bars** - Displays values for the four core dimensions, open, high, low, and close.</li></ul>            |
| [Color strategy](#color-strategy)                      | Controls how colors are applied to dimensions. Choose from:<ul><li>**Since Open** - This mode uses the **Up color** if the intra-period price movement is positive.</li><li>**Since Prior Close** - The color of the candle is based on the inter-period price movement or change in value.</li></ul> |
| Up color/Down color                                    | These options control which colors are used when the price movement is up or down. Note that the **Color strategy** selection determines if intra-period or inter-period price movement is used to select the candle or OHLC bar color.                                                               |
| [Open, High, Low, Close, Volume](#open-high-low-close) | The candlestick visualization attempts to map fields from your data to these dimensions, as appropriate dimension.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Additional fields](#additional-fields)                | The **Include** and **Ignore** options allow the candlestick visualization to display other included data such as simple moving averages, Bollinger bands and more, using the same styles and configurations available in the [time series](ref:time-series-visualization) visualization.             |

#### Color strategy

The **Color strategy** option controls how colors are applied to dimensions. Choose from:

- **Since Open** - The default behavior. This mode uses the **Up color** if the intra-period price movement is positive. In other words, if the value on close is greater or equal to the value on open, the **Up color** is used.
- **Since Prior Close** - An alternative display method where the color of the candle is based on the inter-period price movement or change in value. In other words, if the value on open is greater than the previous value on close, the **Up color** is used. If the value on open is lower than the previous value on close, the **Down color** is used.

  This option also triggers the _hollow candlestick_ visualization mode. Hollow candlesticks indicate that the intra-period movement is positive (value is higher on close than on open), while filled candlesticks indicate the intra-period change is negative (value is lower on close than on open). To learn more, refer to the [explanation of the differences](https://thetradingbible.com/how-to-read-hollow-candlesticks).

#### Open, High, Low, Close, Volume {#open-high-low-close}

The candlestick visualization attempts to map fields from your data to the appropriate dimension:

- **Open** - Starting value of the given period.
- **High** - Highest value of the given period.
- **Low** - Lowest value of the given period.
- **Close** - Final (end) value of the given period.
- **Volume** - Sample count in the given period (for example, number of trades).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
The candlestick visualization legend doesn't display these values.
{{% /admonition %}}

If your data can't be mapped to these dimensions for some reason (for example, because the column names aren't the same), you can map them manually using the **Open**, **High**, **Low**, and **Close** fields under the **Candlestick** options in the panel editor:

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/screenshot-olhc-options-v11.6.png" max-width="400px" alt="Open, High, Low, and Close fields in the panel editor" >}}

#### Additional fields

The candlestick visualization is based on the time series visualization, and it can visualize additional data dimensions beyond open, high, low, close, and volume.
The **Include** and **Ignore** options allow it to visualize other included data such as simple moving averages, Bollinger bands and more, using the same styles and configurations available in the [time series](ref:time-series-visualization) visualization.

### Tooltip options

Tooltip options control the information overlay that appears when you hover over data points in the visualization.

| Option                                  | Description                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Tooltip mode](#tooltip-mode)           | When you hover your cursor over the visualization, Grafana can display tooltips. Choose how tooltips behave.                   |
| [Values sort order](#values-sort-order) | This option controls the order in which values are listed in a tooltip.                                                        |
| [Hover proximity](#hover-proximity)     | Set the hover proximity (in pixels) to control how close the cursor must be to a data point to trigger the tooltip to display. |
| Max width                               | Set the maximum width of the tooltip box.                                                                                      |
| Max height                              | Set the maximum height of the tooltip box. The default is 600 pixels.                                                          |

#### Tooltip mode

When you hover your cursor over the visualization, Grafana can display tooltips. Choose how tooltips behave.

- **Single -** The hover tooltip shows only a single series, the one that you are hovering over on the visualization.
- **All -** The hover tooltip shows all series in the visualization. Grafana highlights the series that you are hovering over in bold in the series list in the tooltip.
- **Hidden -** Do not display the tooltip when you interact with the visualization.

Use an override to hide individual series from the tooltip.

#### Values sort order

When you set the **Tooltip mode** to **All**, the **Values sort order** option is displayed. This option controls the order in which values are listed in a tooltip. Choose from the following:

- **None** - Grafana automatically sorts the values displayed in a tooltip.
- **Ascending** - Values in the tooltip are listed from smallest to largest.
- **Descending** - Values in the tooltip are listed from largest to smallest.

#### Hover proximity

Set the hover proximity (in pixels) to control how close the cursor must be to a data point to trigger the tooltip to display.
The following screen recording shows this option in a time series visualization:

### Legend options

{{< docs/shared lookup="visualizations/legend-options-1.md" source="grafana" version="<GRAFANA_VERSION>" >}}

### Graph styles options

The options under the **Graph styles** section let you control the general appearance of [additional fields](#additional-fields) in the visualization, excluding [color](#standard-options).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

| Option                                      | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Style](#style)                             | Choose whether to display your time-series data as **Lines**, **Bars**, or **Points**. |
| [Line interpolation](#line-interpolation)   | Choose how the graph interpolates the series line. |
| Line width                                  | Set the thickness of the series lines or the outline for bars using the **Line width** slider. |
| Fill opacity                                | Set the series area fill color using the **Fill opacity** slider. |
| [Gradient mode](#gradient-mode)             | Choose a gradient mode to control the gradient fill, which is based on the series color. |
| [Line style](#line-style)                   | Choose a solid, dashed, or dotted line style. |
| [Connect null values](#connect-null-values) | Choose how null values, which are gaps in the data, appear on the graph. |
| [Disconnect values](#disconnect-values)     | Choose whether to set a threshold above which values in the data should be disconnected. |
| [Show points](#show-points)                 | Set whether to show data points to lines or bars. |
| Point size                                  | Set the size of the points, from 1 to 40 pixels in diameter. |

| [Bar alignment](#bar-alignment)             | Set the position of the bar relative to a data point. |
| Bar width factor                            | Set the width of the bar relative to minimum space between data points. A factor of 0.5 means that the bars take up half of the available space between data points. A factor of 1.0 means that the bars take up all available space. |

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Style

Choose whether to display your time-series data as **Lines**, **Bars**, or **Points**.
You can use overrides to combine multiple styles in the same graph. Choose from the following:

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/screenshot-candle-style-v12.0.png" max-width="750px" alt="Graph styles" >}}

#### Line interpolation

Choose how the graph interpolates the series line:

- **Linear** - Points are joined by straight lines.
- **Smooth** - Points are joined by curved lines that smooths transitions between points.
- **Step before** - The line is displayed as steps between points. Points are rendered at the end of the step.
- **Step after** - The line is displayed as steps between points. Points are rendered at the beginning of the step.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/screenshot-candle-interpolation-v12.0.png" max-width="750px" alt="Line interpolation styles" >}}

#### Gradient mode

Choose a gradient mode to control the gradient fill, which is based on the series color. To change the color, use the standard color scheme field option. For more information, refer to [Color scheme](ref:color-scheme).

- **None** - No gradient fill. This is the default setting.
- **Opacity** - An opacity gradient where the opacity of the fill increases as y-axis values increase.
- **Hue** - A subtle gradient that's based on the hue of the series color.
- **Scheme** - A color gradient defined by your [Color scheme](ref:color-scheme). This setting is used for the fill area and line. For more information about scheme, refer to [Scheme gradient mode](#scheme-gradient-mode).

Gradient appearance is influenced by the **Fill opacity** setting. The following image shows the **Fill opacity** set to 50.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/screenshot-candle-gradient-v12.0.png" max-width="750px" alt="Gradient modes" >}}

##### Scheme gradient mode

In **Scheme** gradient mode, the line or bar receives a gradient color defined from the selected **Color scheme** option in the visualization's **Standard** options.

The following image shows a line chart with the **Green-Yellow-Red (by value)** color scheme option selected:

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/screenshot-candle-scheme-grad-1-v12.0.png" max-width="600px" alt="Gradient color scheme" >}}

If the **Color scheme** is set to **From thresholds (by value)** and **Gradient mode** is set to **Scheme**, then the line or bar color changes as it crosses the defined thresholds:

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/screenshot-candle-scheme-grad-2-v12.0.png" max-width="600px" alt="Gradient color scheme with thresholds" >}}

#### Line style

Choose a solid, dashed, or dotted line style:

- **Solid** - Display a solid line. This is the default setting.
- **Dash** - Display a dashed line. When you choose this option, a list appears for you to select the length and gap (length, gap) for the line dashes. Dash spacing is 10, 10 by default.
- **Dots** - Display dotted lines. When you choose this option, a list appears for you to select the gap (length = 0, gap) for the dot spacing. Dot spacing is 0, 10 by default.

{{< figure src="/media/docs/grafana/panels-visualizations/screenshot-candle-line-style-v12.0.png" max-width="750px" alt="Line styles" >}}

{{< docs/shared lookup="visualizations/connect-null-values.md" source="grafana" version="<GRAFANA_VERSION>" leveloffset="+1" >}}

{{< docs/shared lookup="visualizations/disconnect-values.md" source="grafana" version="<GRAFANA_VERSION>" leveloffset="+1" >}}

To change the color, use the standard [color scheme](ref:color-scheme) field option.

#### Show points

Set whether to show data points as lines or bars. Choose from the following:

- **Auto** - Grafana determines a point's visibility based on the density of the data. If the density is low, then points appear.
- **Always** - Show the points regardless of how dense the dataset is.
- **Never** - Don't show points.

#### Stack series

Set whether Grafana stacks or displays series on top of each other. Be cautious when using stacking because it can create misleading graphs. To read more about why stacking might not be the best approach, refer to [The issue with stacking](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/stacking.html). Choose from the following:

- **Off** - Turns off series stacking. When **Off**, all series share the same space in the visualization.
- **Normal** - Stacks series on top of each other.
- **100%** - Stack by percentage where all series add up to 100%.

##### Stack series in groups

The stacking group option is only available as an override. For more information about creating an override, refer to [Configure field overrides](ref:configure-field-overrides).

1. Edit the panel and click **Overrides**.
1. Create a field override for the **Stack series** option.
1. In stacking mode, click **Normal**.
1. Name the stacking group in which you want the series to appear.

   The stacking group name option is only available when you create an override.

#### Bar alignment

Set the position of the bar relative to a data point. In the examples below, **Show points** is set to **Always** which makes it easier to see the difference this setting makes. The points don't change, but the bars change in relationship to the points. Choose from the following:

- **Before** ![Bar alignment before icon](/static/img/docs/time-series-panel/bar-alignment-before.png)
  The bar is drawn before the point. The point is placed on the trailing corner of the bar.
- **Center** ![Bar alignment center icon](/static/img/docs/time-series-panel/bar-alignment-center.png)
  The bar is drawn around the point. The point is placed in the center of the bar. This is the default.
- **After** ![Bar alignment after icon](/static/img/docs/time-series-panel/bar-alignment-after.png)
  The bar is drawn after the point. The point is placed on the leading corner of the bar.
