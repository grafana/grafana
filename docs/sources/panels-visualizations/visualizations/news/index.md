# News

The news visualization displays an RSS feed. By default, it displays articles from the Grafana Labs blog, but you can change this by entering a different RSS feed URL.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
In version 8.5, we discontinued the "Use Proxy" option for Grafana news visualizations. As a result, RSS feeds that are not configured for request by Grafana's frontend (with the appropriate [CORS headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)) may not load.

You can use the news visualization to provide regular news and updates to your users.

## Configure a news visualization

After youâ€™ve created a [dashboard](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/dashboards/build-dashboards/create-dashboard/), enter the URL of an RSS in the **URL** field in the **News** section. This visualization type doesn't accept any other queries, and you shouldn't expect to be able to filter or query the RSS feed data in any way using this visualization.

If you're having trouble loading an RSS feed, you can try rehosting the feed on a different server or using a CORS proxy. A CORS proxy is a tool that allows you to bypass CORS restrictions by making requests to the RSS feed on your behalf. You can find more information about using CORS proxies online.

If you're unable to display an RSS feed using the news visualization, you can try using the community RSS/Atom data source plugin [RSS/Atom data source](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/volkovlabs-rss-datasource/) in combination with the Dynamic text community panel [Dynamic text](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-dynamictext-panel/). This will allow you to display the RSS feed in a different way.

## Supported data formats

The news visualization supports RSS and Atom feeds.
