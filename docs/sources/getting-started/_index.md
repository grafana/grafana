# Get started with Grafana Open Source

Grafana helps you collect, correlate, and visualize data with beautiful dashboards â€” the open source data visualization and monitoring solution that drives informed decisions, enhances system performance, and streamlines troubleshooting.

This section provides guidance to our open source community about how to build your first dashboard after you have installed Grafana. It also provides step-by-step instructions on how to add a Prometheus, InfluxDB, or an MS SQL Server data source. If you are connecting a different data source, please refer to our complete list of supported [Data sources](../datasources/). If you would like to learn how to get started with Grafana Cloud, our fully managed observability stack, visit the [Grafana Cloud documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/quickstart/) for more information.
