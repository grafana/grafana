# RBAC permissions, actions, and scopes

A permission is comprised of an action and a scope. When creating a custom role, consider the actions the user can perform and the resource(s) on which they can perform those actions.

To learn more about the Grafana resources to which you can apply RBAC, refer to [Resources with RBAC permissions]({{< relref "./about-rbac.md#fixed-roles" >}}).

- **Action:** An action describes what tasks a user can perform on a resource.
- **Scope:** A scope describes where an action can be performed, such as reading a specific user profile. In this example, a permission is associated with the scope `users:<userId>` to the relevant role.

## Action definitions

The following list contains role-based access control actions.
