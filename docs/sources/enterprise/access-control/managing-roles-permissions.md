# Managing roles and permissions

You can grant, change and revoke access to a resource by creating and assigning roles to built-in roles. Currently you can do this by either using an API or through provisioning. 

## Grantable resources

See permissions to know which resources are eligible for fine-grained access control.

## Granting and revoking permissions to built-in roles

You can grant permissions to built-in roles by creating a mapping between a built-in role and a custom or predefined role. See the API endpoint for more information.

## Creating and managing custom roles

You can create, update and delete custom roles using an API. Refer to the permissions list for seeing what permissions you need to perform those actions.

## Provisioning

You can create custom roles and grants to built-in roles by using provisioning. For more information refer to Grafana provisioning.
