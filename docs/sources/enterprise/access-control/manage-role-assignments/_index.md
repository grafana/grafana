# Manage role assignments

To grant or revoke access to your users, you can assign [Roles]({{< relref "../roles.md" >}}) to users and teams, or to [Organization roles]({{< relref "../../../administration/manage-users-and-permissions/about-users-and-permissions.md#organization-users-and-permissions" >}}) and the [Grafana Server Admin]({{< relref "../../../administration/manage-users-and-permissions/about-users-and-permissions.md#grafana-server-administrators" >}}) role.

The following pages provide more information on how to manage role assignments:

- [Manage user role assignments]({{< relref "manage-user-role-assignments.md" >}}).
- [Manage team role assignments]({{< relref "manage-team-role-assignments.md" >}}).
- [Manage role assignments to Organization roles and Grafana Server Admin role]({{< relref "manage-built-in-role-assignments.md" >}}).
