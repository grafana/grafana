# Plugin publishing and signing criteria

Grafana plugins must adhere to the Grafana Labs [Plugin Policy](/legal/plugins/). Our review process for publishing and signing will examine your compliance with this policy.

> **Important:** Grafana Labs reserves the right to decline or remove any plugin at its discretion. Failure to comply with publishing and signing criteria may result in immediate removal from the Grafana plugin catalog.

## Plugin licensing

Plugins must be licensed under one of the following AGPL compliant licenses for publishing to the Grafana plugin catalog:

- AGPL-3.0
- Apache-2.0
- BSD
- GPL-3.0
- LGPL-3.0
- MIT

If contributing a plugin on behalf of an organization, be sure to seek guidance from your legal team.
