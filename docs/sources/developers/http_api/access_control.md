# RBAC API

> Role-based access control API is only available in Grafana Cloud or Grafana Enterprise. Read more about [Grafana Enterprise]({{< relref "/docs/grafana/latest/introduction/grafana-enterprise" >}}).

The API can be used to create, update, delete, get, and list roles.

To check which basic or fixed roles have the required permissions, refer to [RBAC role definitions]({{< ref "/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/rbac-fixed-basic-role-definitions" >}}).

### Create a new custom role

`POST /api/access-control/roles`

Creates a new custom role and maps given permissions to that role. Note that roles with the same prefix as [Fixed roles]({{< relref "/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control#fixed-roles" >}}) can't be created.

#### Required permissions

`permissions:type:delegate` scope ensures that users can only create custom roles with the same, or a subset of permissions which the user has.
For example, if a user does not have required permissions for creating users, they won't be able to create a custom role which allows to do that. This is done to prevent escalation of privileges.

| Action      | Scope                     |

| roles:write | permissions:type:delegate |

#### Create role validation errors

Permission validation only occurs when permission validation is enabled (`rbac.permission_validation_enabled = true`).

> It has been enabled by default since Grafana 10.2.

##### Invalid action

The following example shows a request with an invalid action. The action `serviceaccounts.permissions:reader` is not a valid action. The valid action should be `serviceaccounts.permissions:read`.

```http
POST /api/access-control/roles HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
{
	"Name": "Read Service Account with id 6",
	"Permissions": [
			{
			"action": "serviceaccounts.permissions:reader",
			"scope": "serviceaccounts:uid:6"
		}
	]
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
{
	"extra": {
		"validationError": "the provided action was not found in the list of valid actions: serviceaccounts.permissions:reader"
	},
	"message": "Permission contains an invalid action",
	"messageId": "accesscontrol.permission-invalid-action",
	"statusCode": 400,
	"traceID": ""
}
```

##### Invalid scope

The following example shows a request with an invalid scope. The scope `serviceaccounts:serviceaccount6` is not a valid scope for the action `serviceaccounts.permissions:read`. The valid scopes for this action are `*`, `serviceaccounts:*` and `serviceaccounts:id:*`.

```http
POST /api/access-control/roles HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
{
	"Name": "Read Service Account with id 6",
	"Permissions": [
			{
			"action": "serviceaccounts.permissions:read",
			"scope": "serviceaccounts:serviceaccount6"
		}
	]
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
{
	"extra": {
		"validationError": "unknown scope: serviceaccounts:serviceaccount6 for action: serviceaccounts.permissions:read provided, expected prefixes are [* serviceaccounts:* serviceaccounts:id:*]"
	},
	"message": "Invalid scope",
	"messageId": "accesscontrol.permission-invalid-scope",
	"statusCode": 400,
	"traceID": ""
}
```

### Update a role

`PUT /api/access-control/roles/:uid`

Update the role with the given UID, and its permissions. The operation is idempotent and all permissions of the role will be replaced based on the request content. You need to increment the version of the role with each update, otherwise the request will fail.

You can update `custom` roles and `basic` roles permissions. However `fixed` roles cannot be updated.

#### Required permissions

`permissions:type:delegate` scope ensures that users can only update custom roles with the same, or a subset of permissions which the user has.
For example, if a user does not have required permissions for creating users, they won't be able to update a custom role which allows to do that. This is done to prevent escalation of privileges.

| Action      | Scope                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| roles:write | permissions:type:delegate |

#### Example request

```http
PUT /api/access-control/roles/jZrmlLCGka
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "version": 3,
    "name": "custom:delete:write:roles",

#### Update role validation errors

Permission validation only occurs when permission validation is enabled (`rbac.permission_validation_enabled = true`).

> It has been enabled by default since Grafana 10.2.

For more information, refer to [Create role validation errors]({{< ref "#create-role-validation-errors" >}}).

### Delete a custom role

`DELETE /api/access-control/roles/:uid?force=false`

Delete a role with the given UID, and it's permissions. If the role is assigned, the deletion operation will fail, unless the `force` query param is set to `true`, and in that case all assignments will also be deleted.

#### Required permissions

`permissions:type:delegate` scope ensures that users can only delete a custom role with the same, or a subset of permissions which the user has.
For example, if a user does not have required permissions for creating users, they won't be able to delete a custom role which allows to do that.

### Set user role assignments

`PUT /api/access-control/users/:userId/roles`

Update the user's role assignments to match the provided set of UIDs.
This will remove any assigned roles that aren't in the request and add
roles that are in the set but are not already assigned to the user.

If you want to add or remove a single role, consider using
[Add a user role assignment]({{< ref "#add-a-user-role-assignment" >}}) or
