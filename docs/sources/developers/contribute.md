# Contribute to Grafana

This page lists resources for developers who want to contribute to the Grafana software ecosystem or build plugins for Grafana.

## Make technical contributions

Choose how you want to contribute to Grafana, from code to plugins to community support.

### Contribute Code to Grafana

- [Contributing to Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) introduces the contribution process and community resources.
- [Developer guide](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/contribute/developer-guide.md) shows how to set up your environment and run Grafana in development.
- [Architecture guides](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/main/contribute/architecture) explain Grafana’s background architecture.
- [Create a pull request](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/contribute/create-pull-request.md) walks you through preparing a clear, descriptive pull request.
- Browse [help-wanted issues](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) to find a good first task.
- Use the [REST APIs](https://www.grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/developers/http_api) to interact programmatically with the Grafana backend.

### Develop a Plugin

- Read the [plugin development guide](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools) to choose a plugin type, scaffold your project, and develop locally.

### Contribute without code

- Help with [issue triage](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/contribute/triage-issues.md) by reviewing, labeling, and clarifying open issues.
- Submit a [feature request](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/new?template=1-feature_requests.md) to propose improvements.
- Improve our docs with the [documentation contribution guide](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/contribute/documentation).
- Report a bug with the [bug report template](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/new?template=0-bug-report.yaml) and include steps to reproduce.
- Report security vulnerabilities following our [security policy](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/policy).

## Choose the right channel

Use the right place to ask questions, report problems, and propose changes.

- **GitHub issues and pull requests**: Use for reproducible bugs in core Grafana and maintained plugins, small and actionable feature requests, and code or docs changes via pull requests. Avoid general “how do I” questions. For security issues, follow the [security policy](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/policy).
- **Grafana community forums**: Use for questions, troubleshooting, best practices, plugin development Q&A, and early idea discussion. Forums create a searchable public knowledge base that helps others with the same problems and questions. Start here if you are unsure: [Grafana community forums](https://community.grafana.com/).
- **Grafana Community Slack**: Use for quick, time-sensitive chats and networking. Do not rely on Slack for long troubleshooting or decisions. Share outcomes back to a forum topic or GitHub issue/PR to keep a public record: [Grafana Community Slack](https://slack.grafana.com).
- **Not sure where to start?** Start with a forum topic. Maintainers and community members will redirect you if a GitHub issue or pull request is more appropriate.

## Best practices and style
