title: Plugins using AngularJS
description: An annotated list of Grafana plugins using AngularJS.
---

# Plugins using AngularJS

The use of AngularJS in Grafana has been [deprecated](../) in favor of React. Support for AngularJS will be turned off by default in Grafana 11.

This page explains how Grafana users might be impacted by the removal of Angular support based on plugins dependent on this legacy framework. You will also see if there is a migration option available for a given plugin.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
We are greatly appreciative of the developers who have contributed plugins to the Grafana ecosystem. Guidance on migrating a plugin to React can be found in our [migration guide](/developers/plugin-tools/migration-guides/migrate-angularjs-to-react).

## What should I do with the list of AngularJS plugins?

Refer to the [table below](#angularjs-based-plugins) and take the appropriate action for you.

- Consider the advice on whether to update, migrate to a listed alternative, or explore the Grafana plugins [catalog](/grafana/plugins) to find the most suitable option for your use case.
- Use our [detect-angular-dashboards](https://github.com/grafana/detect-angular-dashboards) open source tooling to list dashboards which have a dependency on Angular plugins.
- Check your Grafana instances for usage of these plugins. Refer to the documentation on [browsing installed plugins](../../../administration/plugin-management/#browse-plugins).
- Customers of Grafana Enterprise and users of Grafana Cloud can also leverage [usage insights](../../../dashboards/assess-dashboard-usage/) to prioritize any migration efforts.
- Review the plugin source repositories to add your support to any migration issues or consider forking the repo.

If you want to add any specific migration guidance for your plugin here or update our assessment, please open a PR by clicking **Suggest an edit** at the bottom of this page.

## Private plugins

Grafana OSS and Grafana Enterprise support the creation of private plugins for use on local instances. These plugins may have a dependency on AngularJS and require an update.

The `detect-angular-dashboards` tool listed above will include private plugins in its report **if the Grafana version is v10.1.0 or later**.

Additionally, warning icons and messages will be displayed when browsing the catalog via **Administration** > **Plugins and Data** > **Plugins** in your local instance.

## Automatic migration of plugins

Certain legacy Grafana panel plugins automatically update to their React-based replacements when Angular support is disabled. This migration is usually available within the panel options, as shown in the screenshot below for World Map. Automatic migration can be triggered by setting the feature toggle `autoMigrateOldPanels` to `true`.

Automatic migration is supported for the plugins shown in the following table. Each of the target plugins are included in Grafana as Core plugins which don't require installation.

| Plugin      | Migration target |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Graph (old) | Time Series      |
| Singlestat  | Stat             |
| Stat (old)  | Stat             |
| Table (old) | Table            |
| Worldmap    | Geomap           |

A dashboard must still be saved with the new plugin ID to persist the change.

# AngularJS-based plugins

This table lists plugins which we have detected as having a dependency on AngularJS. For alternatives, consider included [Visualizations](../../../panels-visualizations/visualizations/) and [Data sources](../../../datasources/), as well as external plugins from the [catalog](/grafana/plugins).
