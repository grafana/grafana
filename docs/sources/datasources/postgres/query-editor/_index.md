# PostgreSQL query editor

Grafana query editors are unique for each data source.

For general information on Grafana query editors, refer to [Query editors](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/panels-visualizations/query-transform-data/#query-editors).

For general information on querying data sources in Grafana, refer to [Query and transform data](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/panels-visualizations/query-transform-data/).

The PostgreSQL query editor is located on the [Explore page](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/explore/). You can also access the PostgreSQL query editor from a dashboard panel. Click the ellipsis in the upper right of the panel and select **Edit**.

## PostgreSQL query editor components

The PostgreSQL query editor has two modes: **Builder** and **Code**.

Builder mode helps you build a query using a visual interface. Code mode allows for advanced querying and offers support for complex SQL query writing.

### PostgreSQL Builder mode

The following components will help you build a PostgreSQL query:

- **Format** - Select a format response from the drop-down for the PostgreSQL query. The default is **Table**. If you use the **Time series** format option, one of the columns must be `time`. Refer to [Time series queries](#time-series-queries) for more information.
- **Table** - Select a table from the drop-down. Tables correspond to the chosen database.
- **Data operations** - _Optional_ Select an aggregation from the drop-down. You can add multiple data operations by clicking the **+ sign**. Click the **garbage can icon** to remove data operations.
- **Column** - Select a column on which to run the aggregation.
- **Alias** - _Optional_ Add an alias from the drop-down. You can also add your own alias by typing it in the box and clicking **Enter**. Remove an alias by clicking the **X**.
- **Filter** - Toggle to add filters.
- **Filter by column value** - _Optional_ If you toggle **Filter** you can add a column to filter by from the drop-down. To filter on more columns, click the **+ sign** to the right of the condition drop-down. You can choose a variety of operators from the drop-down next to the condition. When multiple filters are added you can add an `AND` operator to display all true conditions or an `OR` operator to display any true conditions. Use the second drop-down to choose a filter. To remove a filter, click the `X` button next to that filter's drop-down. After selecting a date type column, you can choose **Macros** from the operators list and select `timeFilter` which will add the `$\_\_timeFilter` macro to the query with the selected date column.
- **Group** - Toggle to add **Group by column**.
- **Group by column** - Select a column to filter by from the drop-down. Click the **+sign** to filter by multiple columns. Click the **X** to remove a filter.
- **Order** - Toggle to add an `ORDER BY` statement.
- **Order by** - Select a column to order by from the drop-down. Select ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.
- **Limit** - You can add an optional limit on the number of retrieved results. Default is 50.
- **Preview** - Toggle for a preview of the SQL query generated by the query builder. Preview is toggled on by default.

## PostgreSQL Code mode

To create advanced queries, switch to **Code mode** by clicking **Code** in the upper right of the editor window. Code mode supports the auto-completion of tables, columns, SQL keywords, standard SQL functions, Grafana template variables, and Grafana macros. Columns cannot be completed before a table has been specified.

{{< figure src="/static/img/docs/v92/sql_code_editor.png" class="docs-image--no-shadow" >}}

Select **Table** or **Time Series** as the format. Click the **{}** in the bottom right to format the query. Click the **downward caret** to expand the Code mode editor. **CTRL/CMD + Return** serves as a keyboard shortcut to execute the query.

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
Changes made to a query in Code mode will not transfer to Builder mode and will be discarded. You will be prompted to copy your code to the clipboard to save any changes.

## Macros

You can add macros to your queries to simplify the syntax and enable dynamic elements, such as date range filters.

| Macro example                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$__time(dateColumn)`                                 | Replaces the value with an expression to convert to a UNIX timestamp and renames the column to `time_sec`. Example: `UNIX_TIMESTAMP(dateColumn) AS time_sec`.                                                             |
| `$__timeEpoch(dateColumn)`                            | Replaces the value with an expression to convert to a UNIX Epoch timestamp and renames the column to `time_sec`. Example: `UNIX_TIMESTAMP(dateColumn) AS time_sec`.                                                       |
| `$__timeFilter(dateColumn)`                           | Replaces the value a time range filter using the specified column name. Example: `dateColumn BETWEEN FROM_UNIXTIME(1494410783) AND FROM_UNIXTIME(1494410983)`                                                             |
| `$__timeFrom()`                                       | Replaces the value with the start of the currently active time selection. Example: `FROM_UNIXTIME(1494410783)`                                                                                                            |
| `$__timeTo()`                                         | Replaces the value with the end of the currently active time selection. Example: `FROM_UNIXTIME(1494410983)`                                                                                                              |
| `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m')`                       | Replaces the value with an expression suitable for use in a `GROUP BY` clause. Example: `cast(cast(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(dateColumn)/(300) AS signed)*300 AS signed)`                                                            |
| `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m', 0)`                    | Same as the `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m')` macro, but includes a fill parameter to ensure missing points in the series are added by Grafana, using 0 as the default value. **This applies only to time series queries.** |
| `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m', NULL)`                 | Same as the `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m', 0)` but `NULL` is used as the value for missing points. _This applies only to time series queries._                                                                            |
| `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m', previous)`             | Same as the `$__timeGroup(dateColumn,'5m', previous)` macro, but uses the previous value in the series as the fill value. If no previous value exists, it uses `NULL`. _This applies only to time series queries._        |
| `$__timeGroupAlias(dateColumn,'5m')`                  | Replaces the value identical to `$__timeGroup` but with an added column alias.                                                                                                                                            |
| `$__unixEpochFilter(dateColumn)`                      | Replaces the value by a time range filter using the specified column name with times represented as a UNIX timestamp. Example: `dateColumn > 1494410783 AND dateColumn < 1494497183`                                      |
| `$__unixEpochFrom()`                                  | Replaces the value with the start of the currently active time selection as a UNIX timestamp. Example: `1494410783`                                                                                                       |
| `$__unixEpochTo()`                                    | Replaces the value with the end of the currently active time selection as a UNIX timestamp. Example: `1494497183`                                                                                                         |
| `$__unixEpochNanoFilter(dateColumn)`                  | Replaces the value with a time range filter using the specified column name with time represented as a nanosecond timestamp. Example: `dateColumn > 1494410783152415214 AND dateColumn < 1494497183142514872`             |
| `$__unixEpochNanoFrom()`                              | Replaces the value with the start of the currently active time selection as a nanosecond timestamp. Example: `1494410783152415214`                                                                                        |
| `$__unixEpochNanoTo()`                                | Replaces the value with the end of the currently active time selection as nanosecond timestamp. Example: `1494497183142514872`                                                                                            |
| `$__unixEpochGroup(dateColumn,'5m', [fillmode])`      | Same as `$__timeGroup` but for times stored as Unix timestamp. `fillMode` only works with time series queries.                                                                                                            |
| `$__unixEpochGroupAlias(dateColumn,'5m', [fillmode])` | Same as `$__timeGroup` but also adds a column alias. `fillMode` only works with time series queries.                                                                                                                      |

## Table SQL queries

If the **Format** option is set to **Table**, you can execute virtually any type of SQL query. The Table panel will automatically display the resulting columns and rows from your query.

![Table query](/media/docs/postgres/PostgreSQL-query-editor-v11.4.png)

You can change or customize the name of a Table panel column by using the SQL keyword `AS` syntax.

```sql
SELECT
  title as "Title",
  "user".login as "Created By",
  dashboard.created as "Created On"
FROM dashboard
INNER JOIN "user" on "user".id = dashboard.created_by
WHERE $__timeFilter(dashboard.created)
```

## Time series queries

Set the **Format** option to **Time series** to create and run time series queries.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
To run a time series query you must include a column named `time` that returns either a SQL `datetime` value or a numeric datatype representing the UNIX epoch time in seconds. Additionally, the query results must be sorted by the `time` column for proper visualization in panels.
{{< /admonition >}}

The examples in this section refer to the data in the following table:

```text
+---------------------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
| time_date_time      | value_double | CreatedAt           | hostname |
+---------------------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
| 2020-01-02 03:05:00 | 3.0          | 2020-01-02 03:05:00 | 10.0.1.1 |
| 2020-01-02 03:06:00 | 4.0          | 2020-01-02 03:06:00 | 10.0.1.2 |
| 2020-01-02 03:10:00 | 6.0          | 2020-01-02 03:10:00 | 10.0.1.1 |
| 2020-01-02 03:11:00 | 7.0          | 2020-01-02 03:11:00 | 10.0.1.2 |
| 2020-01-02 03:20:00 | 5.0          | 2020-01-02 03:20:00 | 10.0.1.2 |
+---------------------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
```

Time series query results are returned in [wide data frame format](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/key-concepts/data-frames#wide-format). In the data frame query result, any column, except for time or string-type columns, transforms into value fields. String columns, on the other hand, become field labels.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
For backward compatibility, an exception to this rule applies to queries that return three columns, one of which is a string column named `metric`. Instead of converting the metric column into field labels, it is used as the field name, while the series name is set to its value. See the following example for reference.
{{< /admonition >}}

**Example with `metric` column:**

```sql
SELECT
  $__timeGroupAlias("time_date_time",'5m'),
  min("value_double"),
  'min' as metric
FROM test_data
WHERE $__timeFilter("time_date_time")
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

Data frame result:

```text
+---------------------+-----------------+
| Name: time          | Name: min       |
| Labels:             | Labels:         |
| Type: []time.Time   | Type: []float64 |
+---------------------+-----------------+
| 2020-01-02 03:05:00 | 3               |
| 2020-01-02 03:10:00 | 6               |
+---------------------+-----------------+
```

To customize default series name formatting, refer to [Standard options definitions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/panels-visualizations/configure-standard-options/#display-name).

Following are time series query examples.

**Example using the fill parameter in the $\_\_timeGroupAlias macro to convert null values to be zero instead:**

```sql
SELECT
  $__timeGroupAlias("createdAt",'5m',0),
  sum(value) as value,
  hostname
FROM test_data
WHERE
  $__timeFilter("createdAt")
GROUP BY time, hostname
ORDER BY time
```

Based on the data frame result in the following example, the time series panel will generate two series named _value 10.0.1.1_ and _value 10.0.1.2_. To display the series names as _10.0.1.1_ and _10.0.1.2_, use the [Standard options definitions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/panels-visualizations/configure-standard-options/#display-name) display value `${__field.labels.hostname}`.

Data frame result:

```text
+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| Name: time          | Name: value               | Name: value               |
| Labels:             | Labels: hostname=10.0.1.1 | Labels: hostname=10.0.1.2 |
| Type: []time.Time   | Type: []float64           | Type: []float64           |
+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| 2020-01-02 03:05:00 | 3                         | 4                         |
| 2020-01-02 03:10:00 | 6                         | 7                         |
+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
```

**Example with multiple columns:**

```sql
SELECT
  $__timeGroupAlias("time_date_time",'5m'),
  min("value_double") as "min_value",
  max("value_double") as "max_value"
FROM test_data
WHERE $__timeFilter("time_date_time")
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

Data frame result:

```text
+---------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Name: time          | Name: min_value | Name: max_value |
| Labels:             | Labels:         | Labels:         |
| Type: []time.Time   | Type: []float64 | Type: []float64 |
+---------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| 2020-01-02 03:04:00 | 3               | 4               |
| 2020-01-02 03:05:00 | 6               | 7               |
+---------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
```

## Templating

Instead of hard-coding values like server, application, or sensor names in your metric queries, you can use variables. Variables appear as drop-down select boxes at the top of the dashboard and make it easy to change the data displayed in your dashboard.

For query variables, key/value variables, nested variables, multi-property variables, and using variables in queries, refer to [PostgreSQL template variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/datasources/postgres/template-variables/). For an introduction to template variable types, refer to [Templates](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/dashboards/variables/#templates).

## Annotations

[Annotations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/dashboards/build-dashboards/annotate-visualizations/) allow you to overlay rich event information on top of graphs. Add annotation queries via the **Dashboard settings > Annotations view**.

**Example query using a `time` column with epoch values:**

```sql
SELECT
  epoch_time as time,
  metric1 as text,
  concat_ws(', ', metric1::text, metric2::text) as tags
FROM
  public.test_data
WHERE
  $__unixEpochFilter(epoch_time)
```

**Example region query using `time` and `timeend` columns with epoch values:**

```sql
SELECT
  epoch_time as time,
  epoch_time_end as timeend,
  metric1 as text,
  concat_ws(', ', metric1::text, metric2::text) as tags
FROM
  public.test_data
WHERE
  $__unixEpochFilter(epoch_time)
```

**Example query using a `time` column with a native SQL date/time data type:**

```sql
SELECT
  native_date_time as time,
  metric1 as text,
  concat_ws(', ', metric1::text, metric2::text) as tags
FROM
  public.test_data
WHERE
  $__timeFilter(native_date_time)
```

| Name      | Description                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `time`    | The name of the date/time field, which can be a column with a native SQL date/time data type or epoch value.          |
| `timeend` | Optional name of the end date/time field, which can be a column with a native SQL date/time data type or epoch value. |
| `text`    | Event description field.                                                                                              |
| `tags`    | Optional field name to use for event tags as a comma-separated string.                                                |

## Alerting

Use time series queries to create alerts. Table formatted queries aren't yet supported in alert rule conditions.

For more information regarding alerting refer to the following:

- [Alert rules](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/alerting/fundamentals/alert-rules/)
- [Template annotations and labels](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/alerting/alerting-rules/templates/)
