### Breaking changes

### Fix No Data behaviour in Legacy Alerting

In Grafana 8.2.5 and later, this change fixes a bug in the evaluation of alert rules when using the AND operator to compare two or more conditions. In Grafana 8.2.4 and earlier such alert rules would evaluate to `OK` if at least one, but not all, conditions returned no data. This change fixes that bug such that in Grafana 8.2.5 these alert rules now evaluate to `No Data`.

If an alert should evaluate to `OK` when one or all conditions return `No Data` then this can be done via changing `If no data or all values are null` to `OK`. However, this will not preserve the old behaviour in 8.2.4 where an alert will be `OK` if at least one, but not all, conditions return no data and then `No Data` if all conditions return `No Data`. Issue [#41305](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/41305)
