# In POSIX LDAP schemas, without memberOf attribute a secondary query must be made for groups.
# This is done by enabling group_search_filter below. You must also set member_of= "cn"
# in [servers.attributes] below.

# Users with nested/recursive group membership and an LDAP server that supports LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN
# can set group_search_filter, group_search_filter_user_attribute, group_search_base_dns and member_of
# below in such a way that the user's recursive group membership is considered.
#
# Nested Groups + Active Directory (AD) Example:
#
#   AD groups store the Distinguished Names (DNs) of members, so your filter must
#   recursively search your groups for the authenticating user's DN. For example:
#
#     group_search_filter = "(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=%s)"
#     group_search_filter_user_attribute = "distinguishedName"
#     group_search_base_dns = ["ou=groups,dc=grafana,dc=org"]
#
#     [servers.attributes]
#     ...
#     member_of = "distinguishedName"

## Group search filter, to retrieve the groups of which the user is a member (only set if memberOf attribute is not available)
# group_search_filter = "(&(objectClass=posixGroup)(memberUid=%s))"
## Group search filter user attribute defines what user attribute gets substituted for %s in group_search_filter.
## Defaults to the value of username in [server.attributes]
## Valid options are any of your values in [servers.attributes]
## If you are using nested groups you probably want to set this and member_of in
## [servers.attributes] to "distinguishedName"
# group_search_filter_user_attribute = "distinguishedName"
## An array of the base DNs to search through for groups. Typically uses ou=groups
# group_search_base_dns = ["ou=groups,dc=grafana,dc=org"]
