    # The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is a logging mechanism used to ensure data integrity. In the context of Tempo,
    # the WAL is used to record changes to trace data before they are committed to the main storage.
    #This helps in recovering data in case of a failure. The WAL stores these changes in a sequential log file,
    #which can be replayed to reconstruct the state of the system.
    wal:
      path: /var/lib/tempo/wal
    # indicates that the storage backend is local, meaning the data will be stored on the local filesystem.
