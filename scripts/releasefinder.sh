# This script finds which Grafana releases include a specific commit.
# It checks both release branches and tags to determine:
# 1. Which previous releases include the commit
# 2. Which upcoming releases will include the commit
# 3. The first release that included the commit
#
# Usage: ./scripts/releasefinder.sh <commit-hash>
# The commit hash can be either:
# - Full hash (e.g., 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t)
# - Short hash (e.g., 1a2b3c4d)
#
# Example: ./scripts/releasefinder.sh a1b2c3d4e5f6
#
# If you get a "Permission denied" error, make the script executable with:
#   chmod +x scripts/releasefinder.sh

# Check if script is executable
if [ ! -x "$0" ]; then
