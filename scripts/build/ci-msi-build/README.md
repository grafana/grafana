# Grafana MSI Generator

Creates a docker image that can be included within CircleCI or run locally to generate an MSI for Grafana.

## Docker Image

The docker image is created and published via CircleCI, and can also be built locally.

The image is self contained with all of the code in `/master`.
The detection process expects a zip file in `/master/dist`.

There are two patterns that will be matched for a build in the dist directory:

```
grafana-6.0.0-ca0bc2c5pre3.windows-amd64.zip
grafana-5.4.3.windows-amd64.zip
```

### Building an MSI

The process is automated to expect a dist directory, and will build an msi for first matching grafana-\*.windows-amd64.zip file found.

```
grafana-5.4.3.windows-amd64.zip
```

## CircleCI

## Manual

A wrapper script takes a single argument for the path to a zip file, or searches for a file in dist.

A manual build can be initiated using docker-compose

```
cd oss
docker-compose up --build
```
