This feature is disabled at the moment, because in some cases the "Search Request Done" packet will be handled before the last "Search Request Entry":
   Mulitple internal goroutines to handle network traffic
      Makes library goroutine safe
      Can perform multiple search requests at the same time and return
         the results to the proper goroutine.  All requests are blocking
         requests, so the goroutine does not need special handling
