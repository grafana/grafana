	ChangeManagementDescription        = "The Change Management view provides a comprehensive framework for tracking, managing, and analyzing IT infrastructure changes within an organization. It is designed to support IT Service Management (ITSM) processes by minimizing risks and disruptions associated with changes, while ensuring that all modifications are properly documented and deliver the intended outcomes. The schema integrates detailed records of change requests (CRQ), including their priority, risk level, timing, status, and categorization, allowing for granular reporting and lifecycle tracking. It also logs all work activities, notes, and attachments related to each change, supporting audit trails and compliance requirements. Impacted business and technical areas are tracked, enabling organizations to assess the scope and localization of each change. The view manages relationships between change requests and related entities such as incidents, problems, configuration items, and tasks, providing a holistic perspective on dependencies and impacts. Task-level tracking is included, allowing for the breakdown of changes into actionable items with their own statuses, priorities, and types. Calculated fields such as counts of completed, closed, delayed, and open changes, as well as time-based metrics, facilitate operational reporting and performance analysis. The schema supports both high-level overviews and detailed drill-downs, making it suitable for change managers, auditors, and IT support teams. Use this view when you need to analyze change volumes, monitor change progress, assess risk and impact, or investigate the history and outcomes of specific changes. It is also valuable for compliance reporting, root cause analysis, and continuous improvement initiatives. The inclusion of vendor and support group information enables tracking of third-party involvement and accountability. The schemas rich categorization tiers and association types support advanced filtering and segmentation. Overall, this view is essential for organizations seeking to implement best practices in change management and maintain control over their IT environments."

It tracks associations with related requests or tasks—capturing association type, consolidated status, related request identifiers, descriptions, and classifications—via \"RMS:Associations\". Release financials are covered by joining to \"FIN:Costs\", detailing cost categories, classifications, centers, amounts, units, and company attribution, enabling cost tracking and reporting. Approval process details, including approver identities, signatures, statuses, and workflow names, are available from \"RMS:ReleaseAPDetailSignature\", supporting full transparency of authorization stages. The schema supports robust relationships, ensuring retrieval of all financial, association, and approval records linked to each release, making this view essential for end-to-end release management, audit, and reporting functionalities, as well as calculated summaries such as the total number of releases."
	ServiceManagementFoundationDescription = "This dataset, sourced from the \"CTM:PeopleUserSupportGroupFunctionalRoleLookup\" form, serves as the definitive bridge connecting personnel data with their specific roles and affiliations within the organizational structure of an IT Service Management (ITSM) system. Its primary function is to enable comprehensive lookups based on unique system identifier of a user, typically the Remedy Login ID or Login ID. By querying this table, one can retrieve all essential data points related to IT service responsibilities and location of a person, including the full hierarchy the user Company and Organization, their Region and Site, and crucially, all support-related assignments. This includes the various Support Groups a user is a member of (Group List), the specific groups they can be assigned tickets from (Assignee Groups), and their precise FunctionalRole (e.g. Approver, Manager) within a specific support context. Furthermore, it tracks the membership status (Status-SGP) and the user s general Profile Status, making it indispensable for system provisioning, routing of incidents, and security access control based on granular functional duties."
