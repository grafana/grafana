It’s automatically generated if not provided when creating a folder. The uid allows having consistent URLs for accessing folders and when syncing folders between multiple Grafana installs. This means that changing the title of a folder will not break any bookmarked links to that folder.\nThe uid can have a maximum length of 40 characters.\n\nThe General folder (id=0) is special and is not part of the Folder API which means that you cannot use this API for retrieving information about the General folder."
