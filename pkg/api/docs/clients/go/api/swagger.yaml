  description: "Folders are identified by the identifier (id) and the unique identifier\
    \ (uid).\nThe identifier (id) of a folder is an auto-incrementing numeric value\
    \ and is only unique per Grafana install.\nThe unique identifier (uid) of a folder\
    \ can be used for uniquely identify folders between multiple Grafana installs.\
    \ It’s automatically generated if not provided when creating a folder. The uid\
    \ allows having consistent URLs for accessing folders and when syncing folders\
    \ between multiple Grafana installs. This means that changing the title of a folder\
    \ will not break any bookmarked links to that folder.\nThe uid can have a maximum\
    \ length of 40 characters.\n\nThe General folder (id=0) is special and is not\
    \ part of the Folder API which means that you cannot use this API for retrieving\
    \ information about the General folder."

  description: "The identifier (ID) of a library element is an auto-incrementing numeric\

    \ library element uniquely identifies library elements between multiple Grafana\
