# Toggletip

Toggletips, similar to Tooltips, provide contextual support for users when needed. They are hidden by default, a UI trigger or text link are clicked to set them to their visible state.
Toggletips, unlike tooltips, are persistent until a user takes action to dismiss them by clicking on the required “X” (close) trigger.
Toggletips are capable of containing varying types of complex content including interactive components, buttons, and dropdowns.

## When to use

- Users need further context to understand or learn a topic
- Links to supporting documentation or content are needed to provide
- When an interactive element must be placed within the popover
- When content needs to persist for consumption until the user dismisses it

## When not to use

- When only a primary label or an auxiliary clarification is needed to be displayed (see: Tooltip)
- Do not house information critical to user’s task completion
- Do not request required information from a user to complete a task or workflow

## Content

Toggletips are able to house various types of content. Below is a potential list:

- Buttons
- Text links
- Dropdowns
- Selects
- Images/gifs/videos
- Various combinations of elements — ex: strings of text with buttons and an image
