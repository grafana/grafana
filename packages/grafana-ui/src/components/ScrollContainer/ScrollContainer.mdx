# ScrollContainer

This component is used to create a scrollable container. It uses native scrollbars, has an option to show scroll indicators, and supports most `Box` properties.

## Migrating from CustomScrollbar

ScrollContainer is intended to be a functionally equivalent replacement for CustomScrollbar. If you're not using any additional props in CustomScrollbar, it should be a drop-in replacement.

If you were using additional props, there are roughly 3 categories of changes:

1. Props that have been **renamed**
2. Props that have been removed but the **same behavior can be achieved in a different way**
3. Props that have been removed and are **no longer supported**

### Props that have been renamed

- `autoHeightMin` is now `minHeight`
- `autoHeightMax` is now `maxHeight`
- `divId` is now `id`
- `testId` is now `data-testid`
- `scrollRefCallback` is now `ref`

### Props that have been removed but the same behavior can be achieved in a different way

- `hideHorizontalTrack` and `hideVerticalTrack` have been removed.
  - You can achieve the same behavior by setting either `overflowX` or `overflowY` to `hidden`. These names more closely match the CSS properties they represent.
- `scrollTop` and `setScrollTop`.
  - You can achieve the same behavior by using the `ref` prop to get a reference to the `ScrollContainer` component, and then calling `scrollTo` on that reference.
  - Before:

    ```tsx
    const [scrollTop, setScrollTop] = useState(0);

    return <CustomScrollbar scrollTop={scrollTop}>// Your amazing scrolling content</CustomScrollbar>;
    ```

  - After:

    ```tsx
    const [scrollTop, setScrollTop] = useState(0);
    const scrollRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

    useEffect(() => {
      scrollRef.current?.scrollTo(0, scrollTop);
    }, [scrollTop]);

    return <ScrollContainer ref={scrollRef}>// Your amazing scrolling content</ScrollContainer>;
    ```

### Props that have been removed and are no longer supported

- `autoHide`, `autoHideTimeout` and `hideTracksWhenNotNeeded`.
  - These props no longer make sense when using native scrollbars, since some operating systems (Windows for example) don't have overlay scrollbars.
- `className`
  - Like our other design system components, the intention is that you'll never need to write custom CSS for this component. We extend all the base `Box` props, so everything _should_ be available as a prop.
- `updateAfterMountMs`
  - This wasn't very react-y, and could cause inconsistent behaviour.
