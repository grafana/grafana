# Label

The label component can be used to label form inputs with a heading/"Option name" and a description. To automatically have the right arrangement of this component with a form input, use the `Field` component. There is also a categorised variant of the label, where the heading shows nested categories before the actual option name.

This label component is used in full-page forms in Grafana, for example in the datasource settings. In some parts of Grafana, there are inline forms which do not use this type of label.
