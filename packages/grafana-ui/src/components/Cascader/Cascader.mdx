# Cascader

The cascader component is a `Select` with a cascading flyout menu. When you have lots of options in your select, they can be hard to navigate from a regular dropdown list. In that case you can use the cascader to organize your options into groups hierarchically. Just like in the `Select` component, the cascader input doubles as a search field to quickly jump to a selection without navigating the list.

You can either use the `Simple` cascader component for an empty input as default state or use the `initialValue` or `allowCustomValue` fields to pre-fill your cascader. Initial value means that one of the options from your cascaded list is pre-selected. Custom value means that apart from existing options from the list, your users can add custom values to the list by typing them in the `Select` input.
