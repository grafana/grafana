# ColorPicker

The `ColorPicker` component group consists of several building blocks that are combined in Grafana to create the `ColorPicker`: popover, pickers and palettes. There are different combinations of these building blocks depending on where the `ColorPicker` is used in Grafana.

The `Popover` is a tabbed view where you can switch between `Palettes`. The `NamedColorsPalette` shows an arrangement of preset colors, while the `SpectrumPalette` is an unlimited HSB color picker. The preset colors are optimized to work well with both light and dark theme. `Popover` is triggered, for example, by the series legend of graphs, or by `Pickers`.

The `Pickers` are single circular color fields that show the currently picked color. On click, they open the `Popover`.

## ColorPickerInput

Color picker component, modified to be used inside forms. Supports all usual input props. Allows manually typing in color value as well as selecting it from the popover.

The format in which the color is returned to the `onChange` callback can be customised via `returnColorAs` prop.
