# Combobox

A performant and accessible combobox component that supports both synchronous and asynchronous options loading. It provides type-ahead filtering, keyboard navigation, and virtual scrolling for handling large datasets efficiently.

**Use Combobox when you need:**

- A searchable dropdown with keyboard navigation
- Asynchronous loading of options (e.g., API calls)
- Support for large datasets (1000+ items)
- Type-ahead filtering functionality
- Custom value creation
- Inline form usage (e.g., query editors)

**Consider alternatives when:**

- You have fewer than 4 options (consider `RadioButtonGroup` instead)
- You need complex custom option styling

## Usage & Guidelines

### Options

Options are supplied through the `options` prop as either:

- An array of options for synchronous usage
- An async function that returns a promise resolving to options for user input.

Options can be an array of objects with seperate label and values, or an array of strings which will be used as both the label and value.

While Combobox can handle large sets of options, you should consider both the user experience of searching through many options, and the performance of loading many options from an API.

### Async behaviour

When using Combobox with options from a remote source as the user types, you can supply the `options` prop as an function that is called on each keypress with the current input value and returns a promise resolving to an array of options matching the input.

Consider the following when implementing async behaviour:

- Consumers should return filtered options matching the input. This is bested suited for APIs that support filtering/search.
- When the menu is opened with blank input (e.g. initial click with no selected value) the function will be called with an empty string.
- Consumers should only ever load top-n options from APIs using this async function. If your API does not support filtering, consider loading options yourself and just passing the sync options array in
- Combobox does not cache calls to the async function. If you need this, implement your own caching.
- Calls to the async function are debounced, so consumers should not need to implement this themselves.

### Value

The `value` prop is used to set the selected value of the combobox. A scalar value (the value of options) is preferred over a full option object.

When using async options with seperate labels and values, the `value` prop can be a full option object to ensure the correct label is displayed.

### Sizing

Combobox defaults to filling the width of its container to match other inputs. If that's not desired, set the `width` prop to control the exact input width.

For inline usage, such as in query editors, it may be useful to size the input based on the text content. Set width="auto" to achieve this. In this case, it is also recommended to set maxWidth and minWidth.

### Unit tests

The component requires mocking `getBoundingClientRect` because of virtualisation:

```typescript
beforeAll(() => {
  const mockGetBoundingClientRect = jest.fn(() => ({
    width: 120,
    height: 120,
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    right: 0,
  }));

  Object.defineProperty(Element.prototype, 'getBoundingClientRect', {
    value: mockGetBoundingClientRect,
  });
});
```

#### Select an option by mouse

```jsx
render(<Combobox options={options} onChange={onChangeHandler} value={null} />);

const input = screen.getByRole('combobox');
await userEvent.click(input);

const item = await screen.findByRole('option', { name: 'Option 1' });
await userEvent.click(item);
expect(screen.getByDisplayValue('Option 1')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

#### Select an option by keyboard

```jsx
render(<Combobox options={options} value={null} onChange={onChangeHandler} />);

const input = screen.getByRole('combobox');
await userEvent.type(input, 'Option 3');
await userEvent.keyboard('{ArrowDown}{Enter}');

expect(screen.getByDisplayValue('Option 3')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

## Migrating from Select

Combobox's API is similar to Select, but is greatly simplified. Any workarounds you may have implemented to workaround Select's slow performance are no longer necessary.

Some differences to note:

- Virtualisation is built in, so no separate `VirtualizedSelect` component is needed.
- Async behaviour is built in so a seperate `AsyncSelect` component is not needed
- `isLoading: boolean` has been renamed to `loading: boolean`
- `allowCustomValue` has been renamed to `createCustomValue`.
- When specifying `width="auto"`, `minWidth` is also required.
- Groups are not supported at this time.
- Many props used to control subtle behaviour have been removed to simplify the API and improve performance.
  - Custom render props, or label as ReactNode is not supported at this time. Reach out if you have a hard requirement for this and we can discuss.

For all async behaviour, pass in a function that returns `Promise<ComboboxOption[]>` that will be called when the menu is opened, and on keypress.

```tsx
const loadOptions = useCallback(async (input: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/options?query=${input}`);
  return response.json();
}, []);

<Combobox options={loadOptions} />;
```
