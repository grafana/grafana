# IconButton

This component looks like just an icon but behaves like a button. It fulfils an action when you click it and has hover and focus states. You can choose which icon size you would like to use.

`IconButton` is best used when an actual button would look out of place, for example when you want to place a solitary clickable icon next to text. An example where an `IconButton` is used in Grafana is the top left back arrow in the panel edit mode.
