/**
 * THESE APIS MUST NOT BE USED IN COMMUNITY PLUGINS.

 * Unstable APIs are still in development and are subject to breaking changes

 * Grafana core and internal plugins where we can coordinate changes.
 *
 * Once mature, they will be moved to the main export, be available to plugins via the standard import path,
 * and be subject to the standard policies
