# Grafana Alerting

> **@grafana/alerting is currently in ALPHA**.

This package is a collection of types, libraries, utilities, React components and hooks for interacting with the Grafana alerting system and is meant to be the foundation of alerting-related features in Grafana and its plugins.

We plan to eventually publish this package on NPM; however, it is currently in ALPHA and is not yet ready for public consumption. We are actively working on this package and will be making breaking changes to it as we iterate on the design and implementation.

Once we've settled on a public API that we feel is stable and useful, we will publish this package on NPM and provide documentation on how to use it.
