# Versioned Alerting API clients

1. create a new folder for your new API version
2. create a `api.ts` file in the new folder, see existing ones
3. run `yarn codegen` to generate the `api.get.ts` file, which is your new RTKQ client
4. (optional) create a `types.ts` file in the new folder, see existing ones to enhance the types that are auto-generated.
