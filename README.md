Head to [docs.grafana.org](http://docs.grafana.org/installation/) and [download](https://grafana.com/get)
the latest release.

If you have any problems please read the [troubleshooting guide](http://docs.grafana.org/installation/troubleshooting/).

## Documentation & Support
Be sure to read the [getting started guide](http://docs.grafana.org/guides/gettingstarted/) and the other feature guides.

## Run from master
If you want to build a package yourself, or contribute. Here is a guide for how to do that. You can always find
the latest master builds [here](https://grafana.com/grafana/download)

### Dependencies

- Go 1.9
- NodeJS LTS

### Building the backend
```bash
go get github.com/grafana/grafana
cd ~/go/src/github.com/grafana/grafana
go run build.go setup
go run build.go build
```

### Building frontend assets

For this you need nodejs (v.6+).

```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn install --pure-lockfile
npm run build
```

To rebuild frontend assets (typesript, sass etc) as you change them start the watcher via.

```bash
npm run watch
```

Run tests
```bash
npm run test
```

Run tests in watch mode
```bash
npm run watch-test
```

### Recompile backend on source change

To rebuild on source change.
```bash
go get github.com/Unknwon/bra
bra run
```

Open grafana in your browser (default: `http://localhost:3000`) and login with admin user (default: `user/pass = admin/admin`).

### Dev config

Create a custom.ini in the conf directory to override default configuration options.
You only need to add the options you want to override. Config files are applied in the order of:

1. grafana.ini
1. custom.ini

In your custom.ini uncomment (remove the leading `;`) sign. And set `app_mode = development`.

## Contribute
If you have any idea for an improvement or found a bug do not hesitate to open an issue.

the kickass metrics & devops dashboard we all dream about!
